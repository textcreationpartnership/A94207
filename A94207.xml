            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

moments not to be omitted, are the yawning or gaſping of an hungrie ſoul, a grone under the weight of ſinne, a panting after nearer union with Chriſt. Such is the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of each Chriſtian, of all who are apprehenſive of their own emptineſſe, and affected with it, of all who have not ſcared conſciences, hardened hearts, and ſtupefied affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

               <hi>true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words, I conceive, have a double aſpect, one to S. Paul, another to the doctrine preached by him: Each brings forth twinnes:</p>
            <p>Firſt, they contain the qualities, the value, the worth, the truth and acceptableneſſe of the doctrine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they precede the doctrine; are a preface, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to it. I ſhall deferre the firſt of theſe habitudes till I come to the doctrine it ſelf.</p>
            <p>That reſpect alſo which they have to S. Paul is double: The words ſpeak him who wrote them, a Saint; but may be conſidered as the language of one that had been a Saul, a perſecutour, (that is, of a convert, reflecting upon his ſinnes:) or as the words of a preacher of the Goſpel. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former relation, they may be termed <hi>vox exultan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi> and under the other, <hi>vox evangelizantis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall premiſe to the main doctrine ſomewhat upon the words preceding, as they are a preface or introduction; moreover as they have reſpect to S. Paul.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the firſt, as theſe words, <hi>This is a faithfull ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and worthy of all acceptation,</hi> are a preface or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the doctrine following, they afford us this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, viz. <hi>That mens hearts are ſo perverſe about ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, that art, rhetorick, an holy craft and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is neceſſary in the delivery of points of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, of greateſt advantage, ſuch as hold out to them ſalvation.</hi> We muſt not conceive that S. Pauls Epiſtles written to Timothy, concerned Timothy alone; each Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the New Teſtament, to whomſoever it is inſcribed, may ſerve for the inſtruction of each ſinner (thoſe except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who by the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt have debarred themſelves from heaven) and of each convert. Wicked men are averſe from attending to what would conduce

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>That it is ſo, is evinced from thoſe many aggravations of naturall mens perverſneſſe in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from plain and direct expreſſions of mans perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The 13. of the 2. of Jeremy is to this purpoſe very accommodate; <hi>For my people have committed two evils; they have forſaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</hi> See alſo Jer. 5.3. <hi>O Lord, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou haſt ſticken them, but they have not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction: they have made their faces harder then a rock, they have refuſed to return.</hi> Of many other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſuitable to this occaſion, I ſhall commend to you onely the firſt of the Proverbs, <hi>Wiſdome uttereth her voice in the chief places of concourſe,</hi> ſtretcheth out her hand, playes the Oratreſſe both for elocution and action: but her auditours ſet at nought her counſell, would none of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from thoſe contained in compariſons of men with beaſts. Man is compared to <hi>the beast that periſheth,</hi> Pſal. 49.12. to <hi>the dromedary in the wilderneſſe,</hi> Jer. 2.24. to <hi>a wild aſſes colt,</hi> Job 11.12. to <hi>the deaf adder,</hi> Pſal. 58.4.<note n="*" place="margin">Their thoughts (like cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice egges) break out into viperous words and actions. See <hi>R.D. Kimch.</hi> upon the text.</note> to <hi>cockatrices</hi> and <hi>ſpiders,</hi> Eſay 59.5. to <hi>a horſe ruſhing into the battell,</hi> Jer. 8.6. Brutes, becauſe they want reaſon, oft run away from thoſe that would feed them, and perform to them other good offices, and run into danger.</p>
            <p>The dromedary in the wilderneſſe cannot be taken but in her moneth, when ſhe is bagg'd. The wild aſſes colt is the wildeſt of wild aſſes. The deaf adder, although by ſpitting out his poyſon he might renew his age, ſtoppeth his ears, by applying one to the earth, and covering the other with his tail, leſt he ſhould heare the voice of the charmer. The war-horſe ruſheth upon the pikes, upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:110803:4"/>Man is more brutiſh then beaſts, then the dulleſt of beaſts, Eſa. 1.3. <hi>The ox knoweth his owner, and aſſe his maſters crib; but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider.</hi> Here's what aſtoniſheth both heaven and earth. God layes open his grievances to the heavens, and to the earth, things inanimate; as if thoſe were more intelligent, and more ingenious then men. Iſrael neglected his owner and his nouriſher, God who had choſen him for a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar poſſeſſion, who conſtantly, ſometimes by his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary providence, had maintained him. The ox and the aſſe gave place to their owner and maſter in the ſtable at Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, when as men denied him room in the inne. But this moroſity might proceed from a veniall ignorance; falls much ſhort of that more then brutiſh ſtupidity, which is here deſcribed. Wicked men do not onely refuſe Chriſt, an object of their beneficence in his poore members; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe offering to provide for them: They know that <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is great gain, hath the promiſes of this life and that to come,</hi> and yet reject it.</p>
            <p>In the New Teſtament, wicked men are compared to <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>ſwine,</hi> Matth. 7.6. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither caſt ye your pearls before ſwine, leſt they trample them under their feet, and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and rent you.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Nihil aliud eſt totus mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus ante con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſionem, niſi aut hara porco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, vel collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies rabidorum canum. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> Impure men are here compared to creatures unclean according to the Law, dogs and ſwine. Should you caſt what is precious to ſwine, they are ready to trample it (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>inter pedes ſuos:</hi> if to dogs, they will turn again and bite you. But to trample under their feet, and to turn again, and to rent thoſe that come near them, agree to the nature of both thoſe creatures. In every wicked man there is ſomething anſwerable to each of thoſe ill conditions in dogs and ſwine. They neglect, contemne, and vilifie grace and mercy offered in Chriſt: They <hi>tread under foot the Sonne of God, count the bloud of the Covenant an unholy thing, and do deſpite to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:110803:5"/>Thirdly, from Gods complaining of ſinne and ſinners. This in Greek is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and is defined <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>vituperatio, utpote eorum qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnunt, aut negligunt.</hi> God complains to the heavens and to the earth, that he had <hi>nouriſhed and brought up children,</hi> who <hi>rebelled against him,</hi> Eſa. 1.2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from Gods groning under mens ſtubborn and ſtiffe-necked rebellion. He complains of Iſrael with a ſigh, Eſa. 1.4. <hi>Ah ſinfull nation, a people laden with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, a ſeed of evill doers, children that are corrupters; they have forſaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of Iſrael to anger, they are gone away backward.</hi> 'Tis a ſmall thing that the whole creation groneth under mans ſinne, and travelleth together in pain, Rom. 8.22. God himſelf is preſſed with mens iniquities, <hi>as a cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaves,</hi> Amos 2.13. The Almighty expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth another ſigh, Eſa. 1.24. <hi>Ah, I will eaſe me of mine adverſaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, from God upbraiding ſuch as have been reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in impenitency, Chriſt upbraided the cities, wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, Matth. 11.20. God in holy Scriptures by many accuſations, and reprehenſions, and chidings of ſinners, expoſtulations with them, redargutions of their perverſe wayes, lamentings for their deſtruction, expreſſeth empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically mens averſneſſe from terms of eternall peace and ſalvation. I may adde, that promiſes and threatnings are oft repeated, that ſometimes the hearts of Gods children unleſſe they be mollified with afflictions, will not kindly receive the impreſſions of the Spirit. I ſhall have occaſion of illuſtrating theſe particulars, when I ſhew that <hi>Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> No believer ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely cloſeth with Chriſt, and promiſes founded in him, as that he may not ſeaſonably be the object of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of motives and inducements to nearer union with a Saviour. The Iſraelites in their journey to Canaan had a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110803:5"/>
pull-back-inclination towards Egypt. Lots wife looked back towards Sodome. David muſt be afflicted that he may learn Gods ſtatutes. So you have the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine proved. I ſhall be brief in the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Wicked men have ſinne reigning in them: And there is in each regenerate perſon, together with the kingdome of David the houſe of Saul. Grace and luſt have <hi>junctas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitationes,</hi> though not <hi>diviſum imperium:</hi> though they reigne not together, yet they dwell together. They exiſt not onely <hi>propè,</hi> but <hi>unà;</hi> are not onely <hi>juxta ſe poſita,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>mutuò ſe penetrantia.</hi> They have, though not the ſame father, yet the ſame mother; and as they are ſiſters, ſo alſo twinnes; are together in the wombe, and born to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; in godly men together in each faculty, and in each good action. There's iniquity in the beſt of our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. The godly fall ſo far ſhort of the cloſeſt union poſſible with Chriſt, as they fall ſhort of integrity, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in grace. The godly are not ſo loos'd from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as that S. Paul may imitate the Areopagites, <hi>omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when he ſpeaks to them about ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things. He's wont to premiſe inſinuations: Sometimes he conciliates affection by loving compellations; the word <hi>Brethren</hi> is frequent with him: Sometimes by mild and gentle entreatings, <hi>I beſeech you, be followers of me,</hi> 1. Cor. 4.16. Sometimes by both joyned together, <hi>I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you give up your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice,</hi> Rom. 12.1.</p>
            <p>In my Text there is <hi>inſinuatio ex re <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ta, &amp; ipſis cauſae viſceribus ſumta.</hi> And inſinuation of this kind is moſt potent. We are ready alwayes to enquire <hi>cui bono.</hi> If we ſearch all Rhetoricks cells, we ſhall not find any trope or figure, which was at any time ſo impudent or imprudent, as to perſwade any thing which had not <hi>faciem boni.</hi> The unjuſt judge, (Luke 18.) although he neither feared God, nor regarded man, had his end in avenging the widow of

her adverſary. He did it <hi>ad redimendum vexationem:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, left by her continuall coming ſhe weary me.</p>
            <p>S. Paul borroweth a preface from his doctrine: that furniſheth him with arguments moſt prevalent over mens affections. It's <hi>true and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> Here's<note n="*" place="margin">Themiſt. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. <hi>9.</hi>
               </note>

               </gap>, <hi>aditus illustris.</hi> The Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians rule concerning <hi>Exordium's</hi> is obſerved: Neither is he wanting in the obſervance of that other rule preſcribed by Horace to Poets, (uſefull alſo for Oratours,) <hi>Si vis me flere, dolendum eſt Primùm ipſi tibi.</hi> Himſelf is affected with what he writes to others.</p>
            <p>In the verſe next but one before, he commemorates that he had been a blaſphemer, a perſecutour, and injurious. He addes in that verſe, that <hi>he obtained mercy.</hi> In the 14. verſe he mentioneth his pledges of mercy obtained; of his juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> his faith and love. Theſe graces aſſured him of Gods favour. In the 15. verſe he celebrates and crowns the fountain of all mercy and grace: <hi>'Tis a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> His affections ſtrive with his faith, and as if more nimble, firſt drop out of his pen, get the firſt vent and expreſſion, preface to the Goſpel-doctrine he believed. So I am fallen upon the words of the preface, as they have reſpect to S. Paul.</p>
            <p>They are as ſo conſidered, in the firſt place <hi>(vox con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſi peccatoris in Chriſto exultantis)</hi> the voice of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert triumphing in Gods free grace in Chriſt. He who had ſo much uſed <hi>Eſaus hands,</hi> now hath got <hi>Jacobs voice:</hi> and the context will vindicate him from diſſimulation. Her's <hi>lumen non ſiccum, ſed affectibus maceratum.</hi> Here are good tidings, if true; and they are as true as profitable to ſouls which have been enthralled under ſinne and Satan. They are as true as truth it ſelf. That <hi>Christ come into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> is the onely cordiall to a ſinne-ſick ſoul. Here is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Moreover ſuch truth as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110803:6"/>
is ſuteable to the ſtomach, as well as pleaſing to the palate, ſuch truth as apports nouriſhment to each true Chriſtian. I ſhall ſpeak of the truth and acceptableneſſe of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered by S. Paul, hereafter.</p>
            <p>You ſee how the words of the preface reſpected S. Paul a ſinner: I ſhall now explain them more largely, as they are <hi>vox evangelizantis,</hi> as they are the words of Paul a preacher of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The words of the Preface may be conſidered as reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing S. Paul, a preacher of the Goſpel, both as they are a preface, and as they contain the qualities of the following doctrine. As referred to him under the firſt of thoſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they commend unto us thoſe bowels of pity, and that ſincerity which he uſed in the diſpenſing of Goſpel-truths. As he freely received, ſo he freely and without envie giveth: with the lepers (2. Kings 7.9.) apprehends he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract guilt and blame to himſelf, if he withheld good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: himſelf <hi>eâdem operâ</hi> triumphs in the rich and ſure mercies of the Goſpel, and with beſt advantage commends them to others.</p>
            <p>The words of the preface, as they contain the qualities of the doctrine following, referred to S. Paul, ſpeak him one which taught truth; moreover ſuch truth as was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods faithfull Miniſters, ſuch as labour ſincerely in Gods vineyard, preach truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is worthy of all acceptation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They joyn theſe two together.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the firſt. Thoſe who are faithfull in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery preach truth. This hath been their conſtant practiſe: To give inſtances of all would take up more time then is allowed me. I muſt in the proof of the point rather uſe an example, then an enumeration. S. Paul, as if it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that truth ſhould <hi>viam invenire vel facere,</hi> uſeth the profeſſion of it ſometimes for a preface, and ſometimes for an apologie; for a preface in my Text, <hi>This is a faithfull
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110803:7"/>
ſaying:</hi> for an apologie, Acts 26.25. <hi>I am not mad, moſt noble Festus, but ſpeak forth the words of truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe:</hi> for a preface and apologie together, Rom. 9.1. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lie not, my conſcience alſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> You ſee the practiſe of S. Paul; and he <hi>thought alſo that he had the Spirit of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.40.</p>
            <p>This argumentation although from an example, is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. We may argue from a part to the whole in eſſentialls. And to be well affected towards the truth, is eſſentiall to each ſincere preacher of the Goſpel. Should we eſteem the 17. of the third of the Epiſtle to the Philippians, and the ſixteenth of the fourth of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, in which S. Paul exhorts us <hi>to be followers of him,</hi> to be counſel rather then precept, to have been dictated by a private ſpirit; yet we could not but acknowledge the firſt of the 11. of the firſt to the Corinthians, an Oracle: there he ſaith, <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I am alſo of Chriſt:</hi> Truth is Chriſts banner. The Apoſtles, and all who have been his ſectatours, have fought under it, <hi>&amp; hoc ſigno vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> Chriſt is truth it ſelf, archetypall truth. He is truth eſſentially, ſo could not but uſe it in his expreſſions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theoreticall or practicall. His enemies the Phariſees and Herodians make a glorious confeſſion, Matth. 22.16. <hi>We know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man; for thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt not the perſon of men.</hi> And in John 8.40. <hi>Ye ſeek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God.</hi> He was <hi>born to this end, that he ſhould bear witneſſe of the truth,</hi> Joh. 18.37. He was truth according to his eſſence, likewiſe according to his offices. He was, and likewiſe taught, and by holy violence impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon his ſubjects the true way to ſalvation. He <hi>is the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> Joh. 14.6. He is <hi>full of grace and truth,</hi> Joh. 1.14. <hi>The Law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.17. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110803:7"/>
be ſaved by the Law; the new Covenant, that of grace is the true way to heaven.</p>
            <p>The ſweetneſſe of this truth is deſcribed in the Canticles, <hi>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved amongst the ſonnes; I ſat down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſt,</hi> Cant. 2.3. The fruit of this beloved one is the good tidings of the Goſpel. The hands of thoſe who open to Chriſt (who admit him into their ſouls) <hi>drop with myrrhe,</hi> Can. 5.5. Obedience is truth propagated <hi>(veritas protenſa).</hi> Truth, like the precious ointment wherewith the high Prieſts were inſtalled, runs down from the head into the skirts of each Chriſtians garments. <hi>The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you:</hi> and this anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is truth, 1. Joh. 2.27.</p>
            <p>But neither do I deny that (mor nghobher ngal cappoth hammanghul) <hi>myrrha tranſiens ſuper manubria ſerae,</hi> may fitly be interpreted grace diſpoſing us to admit truth, when it knocks at the doores of our hearts. Myrrhe paſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the handles of the lock, is grace oyling the locks of our hearts: <hi>A kingdome divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi> Thoſe who invent, or propagate falſhood, are Satans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Chriſt prayeth to the Father for his diſciples (Joh. 17.17.) that he would <hi>ſanctifie them through his truth.</hi> He promiſeth his diſciples another <hi>Comforter,</hi> who ſhould <hi>abide with them for ever, even the ſpirit of truth,</hi> Joh. 14.16, 17. cap. 15.26. he foretelleth that the <hi>Spirit of truth ſhould guide them into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. Chriſt is the head of truth, <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> Apoc. 1.11. His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the 24. Elders have the next place to him. Apoc. 4:4. Theſe are the neck of truth, <hi>Beta</hi> and <hi>Pſi.</hi> With the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians the Alphabet was truths ſtatue: <hi>Veritas effingebatur ex literis Graecis, cujus caput ex α &amp; ω, collum ex β &amp; ł, &amp; caetera deinceps membra ex literis prioribus, deinceps ex ſequentibus &amp; posterioribus per ſeriem quandam.</hi> All Gods children, and ſo his faithfull Miniſters are incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110803:8"/>
into truth: Gods Miniſters are ambaſſadours and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents for the God of truth, (and as the Jews are wont to ſay in another ſenſe) ſpeak in the language of him that ſent them. They are anointed with the Spirit of truth.</p>
            <p>You have proof of the point <hi>à poſteriori &amp; á priori.</hi> Here an objection is obvious: Do none of thoſe who have devoted themſelves to the preaching of the Goſpel, ſwerve from truth?</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that they frequently do. I anſwer, firſt that I ſpake concerning ſuch as were ſincere in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. There are ravenous wolves in lambs attire: many out of covetouſneſſe, pretend what ambition will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to perform. If we roll over Eccleſiaſticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, we ſhall find that ambition created all the ancient errours and hereſies. Too many nowadayes are readier to cloſe with errours hatchd by Papiſts, and to arrogate to themſelves to be the firſt inventers of them, then to retain truth profeſſed by thoſe who have ever been thought Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. I yield that ſome betruſted with moſt, are moſt defective in their duties. Some mancipated to themſelves, abound in diſſimulation. I ſpake of ſuch as were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labourers in Gods harveſt; ſuch preach not themſelves, not their own inventions, but the truth of the Goſpel. Secondly, there are reliques of weakneſſe, &amp; imperfection, and darkneſſe in Gods children: they ſometimes embrace a cloud in ſtead of a goddeſſe. I ſhall now propound to you ſome conſiderations which commend truth to us, and will be to us ſo many motives to love it, and uſe it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, true doctrine is to be preferr'd before falſe, becauſe it is more firm and permanent. Plato ſaith in his firſt book <hi>de legib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>What's true may be bitter and unpleaſant, but this is by accident, beſides the nature of truth. The unpleaſantneſſe is not to be imputed to truth, but to the ſubject, the matter about which it is converſant: Who wiſh that this or that report may prove falſe, expreſſe no diſlike of truth. They could wiſh at the ſame time the contrary was true. Thoſe palates are vitiated, diſeaſed, non-ſenſicall, which diſrelliſh truth. Lactantius ſaith wittily and truly (<hi>Divin. Inſtit. epitom. c.</hi> 6.) <hi>Veritas licèt ad praeſens ſit inſuavie, tamen cùm fructus ejus atque utilitas apparuerit, non edium pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet (ut ait Poeta) ſed gratiam.</hi> All truth is amiable, but eſpecially the truths of Chriſtian religion.

               <hi>(life is ſweet)</hi> is a good comment upon this Text. But neither is that of the Pſalmiſt to be pretermitted in its explication, <hi>Gods word is a light to our feet, and a lantern to our ſteps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, truth is the power of God to the converſion of ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:110803:9"/>Fifthly, truth is ſpiritually nutritive of the ſoul. Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fire will not burn. Meat received onely in a dream will not nouriſh. Imaginary truth, Chimera's will not refreſh and feed the ſoul. Errour in the judgement is wont to ſide with perverſneſſe in the will and affections, wickedneſſe in life and converſation. Such is the deſtinie and lot of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. If any doctrines not faithfull ſhould be able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſanctitie, Papiſts tenents concerning a poſſibility of fulfilling the Law, and concerning merit, ſhould be they. But we ſee it is quite otherwiſe: no ſect in the world is more defective in purity of life. God, although wont often to work good out of evil, never cooperates with evil means which ſpoil him of his glory. The Goſpel is the bread of life, <hi>pabulum animarum.</hi> As it is the power of God to the converſion of ſinners, ſo likewiſe to the encreaſe of grace.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110803:9"/>
with their acclamations, <hi>ut corvi fortuitò ſupervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes, in ſtadium deciderent.</hi> They entertained that news of liberty as worthy of acceptation. 'Twas to be wiſhed that thouſands were not duller in their affections, when ſpirituall liberty is offered; when Chriſt offers to reſcue us from our ghoſtly enemies, from thoſe arch-tyrants ſinne and Satan. Certainly this news ought to be welcomed with greater enlargement of affections, with fuller expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of joy and thankfulneſſe. Here's news <hi>worthy of all acceptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Truth and acceptableneſſe concurre together in the doctrine of Gods faithfull Miniſters. Truth and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, I ſay, not truth and acceptance. When light came into the world, when truth was incarnated, ſonnes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial preferred darkneſſe before light. Goſpel-truths are worthy of all acceptation. That they are not at all times accepted, is to be imputed unto the unworthineſſe of ſome to whom they are offered. There's defectiveneſſe in ſuch Miniſters, in whoſe doctrine truth, and worthineſſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation meet not together. Some out of puſillanimity, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or covetouſneſſe, wholly accommodate their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the ſpirits of vain men to whom they preach; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neglect truth, unleſſe it ſerve as a ſtalking-horſe to their own ends. Others buſie themſelves and diſturb the world with empty and worthleſſe curioſities. Luther juſtly complained of the School-men, that they had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>uſes</hi> into <hi>utrums.</hi> Some ſpider-wits ſpin out themſelves into cobwebs.</p>
            <p>There are ſome truths not worthy of all acceptation. Probable conjectures are much to be preferred before pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable falſhood; certain truth before conjectures; acceptable truth before frivolous knowledge: what truths are worthy of all acceptation, ought to have the firſt place in our eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, in our acceptations. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may here adde an opportune caution. No one ought
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110803:10"/>
to arrogate ſuch truth and acceptableneſſe to his own judgement, as may fit it for a rule to be impoſed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Learned D. Davenant in his little Treatiſe zealous for the peace of the Church, determines well, <hi>That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, ſhould they not erre in fundamentals, yet were not to be received into union and communion, becauſe they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon others for a rule of doctrine and manners, the Popes feigned infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this caution an advertiſement will be ſeaſonable. That we may be enabled to preach as we ought, truths <hi>worthy of all acceptation,</hi> knowledge is neceſſary. Truths ſtatue (as I ſaid) conſiſted of the Alphabet. Ignorant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours are unworthy deliverers of truths worthy all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation. <hi>We ſpeak what we know,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Joh. 3.11: <hi>We know what we worſhip,</hi> Joh. 4.22. Thoſe who take upon them to be Chriſts Miniſters, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound their Maſter for a pattern. <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth,</hi> 2.

            <p>I had now done with the firſt part of my Text, but that a direction to another mean conducible to the delivery of faithfull and moſt acceptable doctrine is very convenient. Religion muſt be joyned with knowledge. Many which abound in knowledge, for want of grace invent falſhood, deliver not truth, much leſſe truth worthy of all acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Men enabled by religion, deliver ſaving truths more feelingly, more fully, and more eaſily.</p>
            <p>Theſe are like ſuch as ſpeak of a country or city which they have ſeen, which they have before their eyes: others diſcourſe of ſpirituall things, as if they had ſeen them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in maps. Experimentall knowledge availeth moſt to the efficacious preaching of Theologicall truths.</p>
            <p>I have done with the teſtimony, <hi>This is a faithfull and true ſaying:</hi> I come now <hi>ad rem teſtatam,</hi> the doctrine it ſelf, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> I ſhall in the handling of theſe words onely give you <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma rerum capita,</hi> upon which as I mention them, you may expatiate by your larger meditations.</p>
            <p>Mankind was in a loſt condition, therefore is fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto us by <hi>the lost groat, the loſt ſheep,</hi> and <hi>the prodigall child,</hi> Luke 15. As in a loſt condition, ſo in a ſlaviſh condition, captivated by ſinne and Satan; which condition was ſo much the more wretched, in that we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110803:11"/>
wanted due apprehenſions of our own miſery. We were not onely Satans captives, but mancipated to ſinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells againſt God. We were prone and headling into our own deſtruction, we ſtood in need of one to ſeek us, in that we went aſtray; of one to ſave us, in that we were captivated; one to pardon us, in that we had contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rebelled againſt our Creatour. Theſe three degrees of mans wretchednes are comprehended in the word <hi>ſinners.</hi> But in this Text perhaps, ſuch are called ſinners, who are ſenſible of their ſinnes. Chriſt onely ſaveth ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to ſtand in need of deliverance. He onely healeth ſuch as ſtand in need of a Phyſician, that is, ſuch as are affected with a ſenſe of their maladies. I anſwer, to <hi>ſave</hi> hath a double acception; ſometimes 'tis the ſame that to <hi>pay a ranſome for another, or others; to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their offences:</hi> In this ſenſe Chriſt may be ſaid to ſave all, even ſuch as are not affected with their need of a Saviour. Sometimes to <hi>ſave</hi> implyes ſomewhat more, to wit, <hi>after the ranſome paid, to take out of the hand, out of the power of the enemy ſuch as are ranſomed.</hi> 'Tis ſaid concerning Lot, that <hi>while he lingred, the men laid hold upon his hand, and the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, the Lord being mercifull unto him: and they brought him forth, and ſet him without the city,</hi> Gen. 19.16. Chriſt by the powerfull workings of his Spirit, haleth ſuch as ſhall be ſaved out of the dominion of ſinne and Satan, draweth them to the Father. Here is redemption applyed. None are thus ſaved, but ſuch as are apprehenſive of their naturall bondage. But the ſenſe of our own wants, and ſuch graces as are wrought into the hearts of all that ſhall be ſaved from eternall puniſhments, are to be attributed to Chriſts ſufferings. Grace both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, and concomitant, and ſubſequent, that is, grace prediſpoſing, and grace actually converting, and grace preſerving us in a ſtate of ſalvation, in Gods favour, were purchaſed by Chriſt. He came into the world to pay a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110803:12"/>
price, for the redemption of all mankind; but to ſave efficaciouſly, ſuch as ſhould believe on him. I ſhall take <hi>ſinners</hi> according to the three dimenſions afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and <hi>ſalvation</hi> in its largeſt extent.

            <p>The twelve Patriarchs, Exod. 28. have each of them his precious ſtone inſcribed with his name, in the breſtplate of judgement, a ſymbole of the Church under the Law; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie hath the Calcedonie, Judah the Smaragd: But Revel. 21. in the foundation of the new Jeruſalem, the Church under the Goſpel, Levie hath the Smaragd, and Judah the Calcedon. (The tribes have their ſtones in Aarons breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate according to their births.) Our Saviours Calcedon in Levie's place, telleth us that he hath put an end to Legal ſacrifices. If Leviticall ſacrifices could have expiated ſinnes, it had not been neceſſary that the Prieſthood ſhould have been tranſlated. As a King he farre excelled all who were types of him both in power and honour. Alſheach inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth what is ſpoken Pſal. 45. concerning the Meſſias, to be meant of Iſrael, and by their companions, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heathens' and Angels of miniſtery, &amp;c. Sure we are, that Chriſt was &amp; is exalted above all earthly Monarchs, and above the glorious Angels. Theſe are but <hi>miniſtring ſpirits:</hi> None of them hath dominion over mens hearts. <hi>God ſaid to none of them at any time, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies my footſtool. God ſpake in times paſt by the Prophets,</hi> but poured out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the latter times once for all by his Sonne. Chriſts propheticall office is abundantly more communicable, then either of his other.. No one merely a creature could by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing himſelf expiate mans ſinnes; or yet overſway mens perverſe affections: but what light and information Chriſt imparts to any dark ſoul, he may communicate by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110803:14"/>
miniſters, angels or men. Yet the full revelation to be made of Evangelicall myſteries was reſerv'd for Chriſt, as prerogative to his Propheticall office. What Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd as a Prieſt, and what he performs as a King, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible to none of his creatures. Had not his ſufferings been vigorated by his divine nature, they could not have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt our ſinnes, (by which we offended an infinite God,) before the tribunall of divine juſtice. Neither can any creature create grace in our hearts: no earthly ſcepter can ſway our wills and affections. Theſe are preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Chriſts Kingly office. What Chriſt perform'd or performs as a Prophet (except that he is the fountain of truths revealed) is not impoſſible to a creature. All truths which can be revealed to any, may be communicated to the mind by the miniſtery of angels, may be deriv'd by the eare, or the eye, from theſe or other rationall creatures. Chriſt (beſide that he is the authour of all truths according to his divinity) deferred many truths till the fulneſſe of time, and then as God and man delivered them, that ſo he might exalt even his humane nature, above all Prophets who were before or under the Law, his Miniſters, and but forerunners and types of truth to be incarnated. Chriſt by himſelf, and his diſciples reveal'd ſome myſteries hidden from the beginning of the world,<note n="*" place="margin">Where a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the plain literall ſenſe, was in the intention of the holy Ghoſt to be oftner fulfilled then once, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which foretold it, did alwayes diſtinctly fore-ſee the event in the firſt place foretold, or the firſt fulfilling of his own prediction. There is not the like neceſſity for us to believe or think that he had the like diſtinct fore-ſight or apprehenſion of thoſe events, in which one and the ſelf ſame prophecy was the ſecond, third, or fourth time to be fulfilled. Of ſuch predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as were but once to be fulfilled, &amp; that according to the plain literall ſenſe, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative is univerſally true; (The Prophets had alwayes a diſtinct knowledge or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the ſumme or ſubſtance of the events which are ſaid to come to paſſe, that their ſaying might be fulfilled.) <hi>D. Jackson</hi> in his book entituled, <hi>The knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> chap. 16.</note> explain'd many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uttered. Chriſt was <hi>in denſitaribus ſylvae,</hi> in the Old Teſtament. When God gave the Law on mount Sinai, there were (ſaith Salvianus) <hi>nebulae Deo plena.</hi> There were <hi>nebulae Chriſto plena</hi> in the time of the Law: but in the

               </gap> of Daniels prophecies, which concern'd the laſt times of the world, by which they were much il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated. Plutarch reports (in the life of Lyſander) that the prieſts of Apollo's temple at Delphos, ſubſervient to Lyſanders ambition of the kingdome of Lacedemonia, and what plotted by him and his faction, gave out, That they kept ſecret books of very ancient Oracles, which they themſelves durſt not touch nor handle, neither might any man read them, unleſſe he was begotten of the ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, who ſhould come after a long time, and make his birth appear unto the Prieſts that kept theſe papers, and that by ſome ſecret mark and token, which they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: and thereby being known for Apollo's ſonn, he might then take the books, and reade the ancient reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and propheſies of the ſame. Apollo's prieſts ſeduc'd by covetouſneſſe, abus'd truth into falſhood, by miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. A true prediction touching the ſonne of the onely wiſe God, to be born of a virgin, and his preheminency in unfolding old prophecies, and adding new, receiv'd from Jews, or ſome of the Sybills, or ſome prophet among the Gentiles (as was Balaam) was made the platform of this fiction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt had yet advantage incomprehenſibly greater, then what hitherto mention'd above other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>viz.</hi> according to his divine nature was the donour of the ſpirit of prophecy.

            <p>As it is clear that God determined not the diſpenſation of prophecyes to circumſtances of time and place, nor yet to mens naturall tempers or fortunes; ſo likewiſe that the ſpirit of prophecy found Balaam mingled with malice and covetouſneſſe, and Saul out of envy perſecuting David, how abſtracted ſoever they were from theſe vices whileſt they prophecyed.

God long before the Law given to Moſes, prophecyed to Hagar by the audible voice of an Angel, that her ſonne ſhould be ſpread into a great nation, Gen. 21.18. God after this way ſeverall times reveal'd himſelf (under the Law) in the Old Teſtament, to Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias and the Virgin Mary in the New. God ſometimes ſpake to his Prophets by outward viſions. By fire burning the buſh, but not conſuming it, Exod. 3.2. ſignified to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that the Iſraelites, though heavily afflicted, ſhould not be utterly deſtroyed by the Egyptians. Externall voyces and viſions by which things future were preſignified, were created by God, or produc'd by the miniſtery of Angels. Viſions might, many of them be carv'd in wood, ſtone, other matter; more of them (yet not all) be painted. It's impoſſible to engrave fire, or to paint ſounds. The hand-writing upon the wall, which Daniel read, ſupplied the place of propheticall ſpeech. Each propheticall ſpeech might be exhibited in letters. God ſpake ſometimes by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim and Thummim, on the breaſt of the high Prieſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this kind of prediction, ſee Lev. 8.8. Numb. 27.21. 1.

            <p>Leſt any demand, why propheticall influences, or any other ſymbole of Gods extraordinary preſence, ſhould be called by the name of the third, rather then of the firſt or ſecond perſon of the ſacred Trinity, I propound as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable theſe reaſons following.</p>

            <p>As Prophets could not foretell all things, ſo neither had they thoſe ſupernaturall impreſſions which they received, remaining with them at all times. Propheticall light was in their underſtanding as in the aire, not as in the Sunne. S. Paul ſpake with tongues more then all the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 14.18. probably with more then the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by acquired skill; but God ſuggeſted language to each of his extraordinary miniſters according to neceſſity.</p>
            <p>That I may yet further explain idea's impreſs'd upon the minds of Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall ſhew how they differed one kind of them from the other. The <hi>word of the Lord</hi> in the mind
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110803:25"/>
of the Prophet, is of the ſame nature with repreſentations produc'd by words; <hi>Viſion</hi> after the manner of reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ariſing from things: <hi>Sicut humana conſuetudo verbis, ità divina potentia factis loquitur,</hi> (as S. Auſtine in his 49. epiſtle.) He who by his word created the world, doth by his power alſo form his creatures into words. Nor doth he in this way onely apply himſelf to the outward ſenſes, as did Tarquinius to the meſſenger ſent from his ſonne, by lopping off the heads of the talleſt poppies. Who received Propheticall viſion, had elegant characters written in their minds by the finger of God. Her's eloquence above the ſtyle of humane expreſſion. In the firſt chapter of Ezechiel the eighth verſe, <hi>Behold, I even I am against thee, and will execute judgements in the midſt of thee, in the ſight of the heathen.</hi> Here's <hi>Verbum Domini. Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> is prefix'd before it. In the ſecond verſe of the tenth chap. <hi>And he ſpake unto the man cloth'd in linen, and ſaid, Go in between the wheels, even under the Cherub, and fill thy hand with coals of fire from between the Cherubims, and ſcatter them over the city. And he went in my ſight.</hi> Here is <hi>viſion.</hi> There the <hi>ſpecies</hi> impreſs'd in the mind of the Prophet were immediately <hi>verborum,</hi> but there <hi>rerum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> There ſeemed ſomething to be <hi>ſpoken,</hi> here ſomewhat to be <hi>done.</hi> There the Lord foretold the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, here by coles of fire ſcattered over the city, praefigur'd it. The word of the Lord was either proper or tropicall; and ſometimes was contain'd in one trope, and ſometimes in an allegory: of this laſt ſort is that Eſay 6.25. <hi>The wolf and the lambe ſhall feed together.</hi> The ſame diſtinction hath place in viſion.</p>
            <p>In externall viſions there might be <hi>tropi &amp; allegoria re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> by which future things were preſignified. Again, what was preſented to the eye, was ſometimes reall, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times merely an apparition: of the former ſort was the cloud which appeared to Elijahs ſervant; and according t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Aben-ezra, the fire in the buſh which conſumed it not. His

words are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that <hi>it was in the buſh, burning round about.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the fire to purifie the place of the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence here, as afterwards the Mount on which the law was given. <hi>The mountain burned with fire,</hi> Deut. 9.15. The <hi>Shechinah</hi> had fire with it in the firſt temple. Of the other ſort of externall viſions (not improbably) was <hi>the writing upon the wall</hi> read by Daniel (Dan. 5.17.) By the <hi>viſion of the cloud</hi> rain was foretold; by <hi>the fire in the buſh not conſuming it,</hi> God reveal'd to Moſes that the Iſraelites afflicted by the Egyptians ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. That was a tropicall viſion, this an allegoricall. In the minds of Prophets (which I may fitly terme Theaters of future events,) we may obſerve the like difference of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They were proper, tropicall, or allegoricall. To this laſt ſort may be referred what we have in the 8. verſe of the 8. chapter of the Revelation. <hi>A great mountain burning with fire was caſt into the ſea, and the third part of the ſea became bloud. As alſo third parts of the ſunne, moon, and ſtarres darkened, and the day and night not ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for a third part,</hi> verſe 12. <hi>And the ſtarre falling down from heaven to earth,</hi> Rev. 9.1. the <hi>locuſts coming out of the ſmoke upon the earth,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 3. ſuch alſo the viſions of <hi>the horſes, and them that ſate on them,</hi> verſes the 17, 18, 19. by the inſtances given the firſt difference of <hi>viſion and the word of the Lord</hi> is ſufficiently illuſtrated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe differed, in that <hi>viſion</hi> oft times by ſimple appearances, by terms of invention, as hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks, exhibited what ſhould come to paſſe. Such was the viſion of the <hi>ſeven thunders,</hi> Rev. 10.4. this is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſounds. This queſtion is propounded in Plato (<hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de repub.</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110803:26"/>
ſenſible objects? His anſwer is affirmative. Each kind of ſenſible objects are ſeen by that ſenſe to which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable. Colours are ſeen by the eye, &amp; ſounds by the eare, &amp;c. Both ſounds and colours, all things which were apprehended by any Prophet, ſuch excepted as had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations anſwerable to articulate and ſignificant voices, were ſeen by the mind. This of thunder is (I ſay) <hi>a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſounds.</hi> Here <hi>Deus factis loquitur;</hi> here things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the eye of the mind, repreſent other things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from themſelves. But <hi>the word of the Lord</hi> requireth axiomaticall diſpoſition, as we may gather from examples throughout the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prophetical viſion</hi> had evermore <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> joyned with it, unleſſe it exhibited to the mind proper repreſentations of things preſignified. But <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> if conceived in tropicall, or alſo allegoricall terms, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it was to be exhibited to the people; if not clear by it ſelf, was in proper repreſentations, which alſo were <hi>verbum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> elucidated in the mind of the prophet.

He onely telleth what is preſent, but cannot foretell what is future, who imparteth to others propheticall reſemblances which he doth not underſtand: neither viſions allegoricall, or ſimply tropicall, ſufficed to predictions. This is clear from<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> Pharaohs two dreams. Although <hi>he ſaw ſeven ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and lean-fleſhed kine to devoure ſeven well-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and fat kine;</hi> and <hi>the ſeven thinne ears of corn, to devoure the ſeven rank and full ears,</hi> yet he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not that there ſhould enſue <hi>ſeven good years,</hi> and after thoſe <hi>ſeven bad years,</hi> and that the ſcarcity ſhould conſume the plenty, till he met with an interpreter. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph through divine illumination could expound Pharaohs viſions, in like manner as if they had been originally his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110803:26"/>
own. This light vouchſafed to Joſeph was like ſuch ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes as are wont to be produc'd by ſpeech, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently was <hi>verbum Domini.</hi> His underſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſo illuminated could not certainly apprehend from the dreams what ſhould come to paſſe (although he ſhould have known that they were ſent into Pharaohs mind by God, and that they were ſignificative of ſomewhat fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) no more then by its ſelf infallibly foreknow contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things. No created mind can be raiſed into this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicacity. Preſcience of what is contingent is proper and peculiar to God. Propheticall viſion was oft times illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, as we ſee, by <hi>the word of the Lord. The word of the Lord</hi> was manifeſt in it ſelf, or declar'd by propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call influence of the ſame kind. This is their third diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. I acknowledge (without revocation of what hath been ſaid concerning <hi>viſion</hi> and <hi>the word of the Lord</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,) that a prophet inform'd by either kind of divine influences mentioned was called (<hi>Roeh</hi> and <hi>chozeh) a ſeer,</hi> and that God ſpake to his prophets by <hi>viſions.</hi> I well attend that the word of the Lord to Ananias, is call'd (<gap reason="foreign">

Chriſt, when he had expounded the Scriptures to his diſciples, <hi>open'd their understandings,</hi> Luke 24.44, 45. God by giving <hi>the ſpirit of prophecy,</hi> illuſtrated what was to be known, illuminated the minds of thoſe to whom he communicated himſelf, and made what was remote actually intelligible. Moreover <hi>viſion</hi> and <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> in the minds of prophets were repreſentative of things compounded or divided. Themiſtius tells us that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that <hi>intellectus agens</hi> is moſt like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.

What Ariſtotle (as appears from his words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited) attributes to a light within us, Plato (<hi>de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. lib.</hi> 6.) referres to a ſunne without us; to him who is <hi>the true light, that enlighteneth every one that cometh into the world,</hi> (I mean) to the eternall Sonne of God.

And the dignity of the high Prieſt reſulting from this ornament was the more conſpicuous, in that revelation was in the firſt place made to himſelf alone, and by him communicated to thoſe who came to enquire of the Lord. When any enquired, the Prieſt ſtood with his face before the Ark; and he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſtood behind him, with his face to the back of the Prieſt, if we may believe Maimonie, &amp;c. Paul inſtructed by a differing kind of revelation, had as great advantage of his fellow-travellers. He heard an articulate voice, they onely a ſound. God oft convers'd as privately, but not ſo familiarly, with thoſe to whom he communicated himſelf by outward, as with them into whom he inſpired inward repreſentations of things to be made known. God was more intimate to theſe tranſcrib'd himſelf into their minds: they were <hi>pleni Deo.</hi> But howſoever idea's of things to be known infus'd into the mind, were more a mans own then thoſe that were objects of the eare or the eye; the word of the Lord deriv'd by the ſenſe of hearing, or (when written) by ſight, more enabled to prediction of things to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Externall viſion, howſoever tropicall, together with the word of the Lord interpreting it, ſuffic'd to the foretelling of what ſhould come to paſſe; and internall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, unleſſe exhibited in proper reſemblances, plain terms, was impotent to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The externall word was ſufficient by it ſelf to make a Prophet. Samuel by the Lords ſpeaking audibly to him, was known to be a Prophet throughout Iſrael.</p>

Chriſt in that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humane nature he was pure from guilt, could not be aſtoniſhed with fear; nor yet, ſith nothing befell him whereof he knew not the reaſon, with admiration. The inferiour part of his ſoul was ſo far conform'd to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and this to Gods will, that I cannot conceive that he was obnoxious to ecſtaſies of the ſecond kind. Divine truths were familiar to him: it was as <hi>meat and drink to him to do the will of his Father.</hi> Foraſmuch as he was not touch'd with fear, nor yet rais'd above his ordinary temper and capacity, when revelation was ſuggeſted to his humane nature, he was illuminated without detriment to the ſtrength of his body and ſenſitive faculties. That I may conclude this article, each kind of ecſtaſie in ſome reſpect or other denoteth imperfection. Moſes is by Jews more exempted from them then the reſt of the Prophets. Our Saviour was humbled by his ſufferings, but ſo as he ever remain'd moſt eminent in his offices.</p>

But neither is rejoycing abſtracted from thankfulneſſe: both are requiſite.

Thoſe are ſwine which feed upon akorns, but never look up to the tree. S. Paul expreſſeth both in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of his doctrine. He thankfully acknowledges how advantagious Chriſts <hi>coming into the world</hi> was to himſelf <hi>the chief of ſinners.</hi> And certainly that acclamation of the Church is the voice of thankfulneſſe, as well as of rejoycing.

The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of any good towards us is matter of joy; and if it be freely beſtowed upon us, likewiſe of thankfulneſſe; and ſo much more of thankfulneſſe, by how much the more freely it comes from the Donour.

Aquin. 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 106. <hi>art.</hi> 2.) more obligeth to thankfulneſſe, then grace conferr'd at our creation, <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (that I may uſe his words) <hi>magis datur gratis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt ſhew, That Chriſts coming intimated ſome
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:110803:41"/>
good towards us: ſecondly, That he came freely. The former of theſe propoſitions is clear'd from the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> of his motion, together with the freeneſſe of the motion it ſelf. I muſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent take for a <hi>poſtulatum</hi> what I ſhall hereafter prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was not compelled into the world. What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides is repugnant to the freeneſſe of his coming (as morall neceſſity, by ſome fondly conceived to be caſt upon him by mans merits) cannot import that his coming ſhould not be advantagious to us. Chriſt freely diſrob'd himſelf of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, aſſum'd the rags of our nature, and ſo diſguiſed viſited ſinfull mankind. That one completely well, much more a great man, a Prince, ſhould beſtow a viſit upon one ſick: That any one ſhould own a friend in great diſtreſſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one guilty of treaſon, is wont to be eſteem'd a great favour. A traytour, if his Sovereigne caſt a favourable eye upon him, interprets it a pledge of his propitious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; erects his languiſhing ſpirits. Here the Monarch of heaven and earth viſiteth mankind in ſickneſſe and diſtreſſe, ſuch as were disaffected towards him, ſuch as were traytours againſt him. What is the ordinary temper of the world, Cyprian well expreſſeth in his ſecond Epiſtle. I have not met with any Authour more elegant and copious to this purpoſe, yet conceive that his expreſsions ſettle much below his ſubject. I ſhall onely give you a taſt of him, you have acceſſe to the reſt at your leaſure. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisper te crede ſubduci in montis ardui verticem cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiorem, ſpeculare inde rerum infra te jacentium faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; &amp; oculis in diverſa porrectis, ipſe à terrenis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tactibus liber, fluctuantis mundi turbines intuere.

How wicked that generation was, beſides teſtimonies in ſacred Scriptures, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane writings, we may in part conjecture from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments viſited upon themſelves, and already upon their poſterity.

This is a good <hi>omen.</hi> We cannot but ſuſpect his coming beſides ſome good towards us. Chriſts coming into the world to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the circumſtances of it, inſinuate what is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs'd, Matth. 20.28. <hi>That the Sonne of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſome for many;</hi> His coming, foraſmuch as it was not forced, neither deſireable in order to his own ends, muſt needs be undertaken for the benefit of ſome others, and of men rather then of angels. <hi>He in no ſort took the Angels, but he took the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.16.

            <p>A ſecond ſcruteny will diſcover in it matter of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe. Thankfullneſſe (according to Thomas Aquinas 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 106. <hi>art.</hi> 2.) is two wayes engag'd. Firſt, <hi>(ex quantitate dati)</hi> by the greatneſſe of a gift.

The gift it ſelf is naked, unleſſe (as Civilians ſpeak) <hi>conſenſu veſtiatur.</hi> The benefits about to reſult from Chriſts birth, by the circumſtances of his coming, are intimated to be great of the firſt magnitude.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110803:42"/>
And what good ſoever acerueth to us by his birth, was conceiv'd in the wombe of free mercy. When as ſacrifice and offering, burnt offerings and ſinne offerings could not appeaſe divine juſtice, <hi>then I ſaid, lo I come, that I ſhould do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>He humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and became obedient to the death, even the death of the croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2.8.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour was not merited into the world. 2. not compelled. Firſt, of the firſt: mankind could not by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of merits exact Chriſts incarnation and birth. The then preſent generation did not merit his coming.<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> So farre thoſe to whom he came were from meriting his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that, ſome few excepted, they deſired him not before he came; welcom'd him not into the world, when as he came of his own accord; accepted him not when as he had declared his gracious intentions. I ſhall afterward <hi>ex eadem fidelia</hi> prove, that neither ſuch as believed at the time of our Saviours coming, nor yet the Patriarchs could merit his incarnation and birth. Firſt, of the firſt; 'Tis an axiome in the Civill Law. <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus debet approbari.</hi> But Chriſts coming, although it moſt nearly concern'd all the Jews, was ſo farre from being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag'd by their merits, that it was not voted by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. He came unſent for. The Jews ſome few excepted, and Gentiles generally were affected in like manner with our firſt parents in Paradiſe after their fall; readier to runne away from God, and to hide themſelves from him, then to ſeek after him. God ſought out Adam and Eve, when they endeavoured to ſhun him, and tendered to them a gracious promiſe, before they cryed mercy.

               </gap> (as diſcovered by arts of grace now mentioned,) by the ſimilitude of a prince, not permitting his ſubjects in rebellion, but endeavouring by all acts to reduce them to their duties. The holy Ghoſt in S. Luke (chap. 15.) uſeth the ſimilitudes of <hi>a woman ſeeking a lost great,</hi> and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110803:43"/>

A ſhepherd with a ſheep upon his ſhoulder, engravened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the communion cup in Primitive times of the Goſpel, imported the ſame notion. Chriſt took upon him our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: overtook it, by running after it, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; alſo ſignifies. Thoſe Jews who lived when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was born, were a generation of vipers, did eat through the bowels of their mother, the more ancient Church. Two tenents they almoſt generally embraced which could not conſiſt with a deſire or yet expectation of ſuch a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. 1. They cryed up juſtification by the works of the Law. They were ſo farre from ſeeking after a Phyſitian, that they could not acknowledge themſelves diſeas'd. 2. They expected that their Meſſias ſhould be an earthly Monarch; that his kingdome ſhould be of this world, that he ſhould by civill power ſubdue the heathen. Theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions crucifie the croſſe of Chriſt, are moſt repugnant to that way which God in his infinite wiſdome had contriv'd for the ſaving of mankind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as they ſent not for our Saviour before he came, ſo neither did they courteouſly entertain him coming of his own accord. He was rejected into a ſtable<note n="*" place="margin">

Beſides that it is better to be a beaſt then to be like one, brute creatures were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſubject unto him; men diſobeyed him.

Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie Jeremy the ſonne of Eliezer ſaith, that God did not onely make a covenant with the ſea, but in like manner
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110803:43"/>
with all things which he had created within the ſix dayes. This ſentence is to be preferred. All creatures void of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have obſerved this covenant. All creatures wanting reaſon have in themſelves ſo much ſelf-deniall, that they are ready even againſt their particular natures, and to their private detriment, to obey Gods command. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the red ſea ſtood upon an heap, that the Iſraelites might be accommodated with a way to eſcape from the Egyptians. The waters of the river Jordan, that they might open to them a paſſage into the promiſed land. The ſunne ſtood ſtill that they might conquer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites; went backward that he might ſignifie time added to Hezekiah's life. The fire ſpared the three children. Such creatures as have ſenſe, and the faculty of feeling pains if their appetites be not ſatisfied, have at Gods command uſed heroicall abſtinency. The Lyons, whoſe denne was made a priſon to Daniel, made good what God promiſeth, Pſal. 34.10. <hi>The Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord, lack nothing which is good. The Ravens fed Elijah by the brok Cherith,</hi> 1. Kings 17.4. When as Jonah commanded to Nineveh, endeavoureth to flie to Tarſhiſh, that is, the contrary way, a Whale brings him back again, lands him on the right ſhore. Men have frequently neglected their God. <hi>When our Saviour came to ſeek his own, his own received him not. The Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head,</hi> Matth. 8.20. That the Meſſias when he cometh ſhall not have whereon to ſit, where to reſt his body, is affirm'd by the Gemariſts. Our Saviour may ſeem to have alluded to ſuch a tradition in the expreſſion quoted.</p>
            <p>Yet there remain other circumſtances, which more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate Chriſts love to mankind; and in that they were foreſeen, likewiſe the freeneſſe of his coming. As he came of his own accord, was not ſent for, disrob'd himſelf of majeſty, look'd upon ſuch as were his enemies, yea rebells
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110803:44"/>
againſt him with a friendly aſpect, was not welcom'd not courteouſly entertained at his coming; ſo neither was he accepted after ſuch time as he had declared his gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. He came among ſuch as were contumaciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, ſo faſtened to their luſts, glued to this preſent evil world, that they would not accept of a Saviour upon moſt gracious terms offered. When light came into the world, they preferred darkneſſe. <hi>The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil,</hi> John 7.7. <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you,</hi> Joh. 15.18. The Gergeſens loved their ſwine better then a Saviour. The Jews prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Barabbas before Chriſt; an enemy to publick ſafety, before one that came to ſave mankind. As he was vilified throughout his life, ſo at laſt by a violent death thruſt out of the world.<note n="*" place="margin">It hath been confeſsd by ancient Jews, likewiſe by Talmudiſts, that the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as was to be expected about the end of 4000 years from the Creation. <gap reason="foreign">

Had Chriſt come to reſcue ſuch as were entire and upright, but enſlaved to men; or to ſatisfie for ſuch as had offended men; or to deliver ſuch as had offended God from temporall puniſhments; or onely to eſtabliſh the Angels his friends, yet ſhould he have done what all would have looked upon, as much to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by thoſe whom it might concern.

There remain two other depths in Chriſts coming to ſave ſinners, which render his goodneſſe as admirable as his wiſdome. 1. 'Twould be an injury with men (as Salvian well obſerved) to puniſh a good ſonne for a bad ſervant. Here's ſcarce any difficulty; but I may opportunely ſuggeſt, that as Chriſts willingneſſe to ſuffer for us, aſſerts the juſtice of God the Father; ſo it is a remarkable part of his free mercy towards us. Chriſt of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110803:47"/>
his own accord laid down his life for us. 2. Take into your meditations, who were the objects of Chriſts mercy. They were his enemies. It's too frequently a peice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice amongſt men, to reſcue by ſtrong hand and abuſe of authority, thoſe from puniſhment who deſerve to ſuffer. <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi> God without derogation from his juſtice freely remits what men had ſinned againſt himſelf. He declared together with his juſtice his holineſſe likewiſe, in bringing ſinne to condigne puniſhment; and moreover emphatically his rich goodneſſe, by ſuffering for ſinners and ſuch as were rebels againſt himſelf. A young ſtudent of Hiſtory (ſaith Polibius) <hi>univerſam mundi hiſtoriam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet uno intuitu complecti, &amp; velut in corpus redigere.</hi> This work is done to our hands in the hiſtory of Gods mercies and free love towards us. Chriſt by ſuffering death for us, did <hi>omnem bonitatem</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. All other ſpirituall bleſſings meet in this as the <hi>radii</hi> in the center, and as ſtreams in the fountain: God's pleas'd to accumulate one mercy upon another. God the Father out of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was pleas'd to ſend his Sonne into the world to die for ſinners; and to make this mercy the foundation of others neceſſary in order to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>To ſave ſinners</hi> was the end, the main deſigne of Chriſts coming into the world. Calvine chaſtiſeth Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus affirming that Chriſt ſhould have come into the world, although man had not ſinned. <hi>To ſave ſinners</hi> was the work for which he came down from heaven. <hi>Lord ſpeak the word onely,</hi> (ſaid the Centurion Matth. 8.8.) <hi>and my ſervant ſhall be healed.</hi> Jeſus at a diſtance by his word cured the bodily infirmity of the Centurions ſervant. God by his word created the world. God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light; and there was light,</hi> &amp;c. Many conceive that God in regard of his holineſſe could not remit mans ſinnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatisfaction. All agree, that the way of which he was pleaſed to make choice for our recovery; was in many reſpects moſt convenient. That our ſpirituall infirmities
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110803:47"/>
might be cured, that man might be re-created, 'twas requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that God ſhould come down from heaven, and that he ſhould not merely ſpeak the word, <hi>(be ye ſaved)</hi> but that he ſhould do and ſuffer many things for us. Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption put God to greater expence then did our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A ſigne that we had ſunk our ſelves below nothing! <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi virtus</hi> (ſaith Plinie) <hi>ibi etiam fortuna.</hi> Here are good tidings for thoſe, who were altogether void of virtue: here's <hi>ſalvation for ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> is a doctrine <hi>worthy of all acceptation.</hi> 1. This doctrine is acceptable in regard of its authour. Should an earthly Prince ſpeak, we ſhould hear him with greedy attention. 2. Acceptable in regard of thoſe by whom it was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was preached by Angels to Joſeph the husband of Mary, and the ſhepherds; by the Apoſtles, by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 3. Acceptable in that contain'd in plain terms. Many parts of Philoſophy are obſcure, and the anſwers of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were oft ambiguous: <hi>vitreum vas lambimus, ſed pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non attingimus.</hi> This doctrine is ſo clear, that he that runneth may read and underſtand. Thoſe who are of weak capacities, are not debar'd from it. They may taſt how good and gracious the Lord is. But ſome truths not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall have their ſhare in theſe conditions. 4. This doctrine in regard of its matter, <hi>is worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is the very life and ſoul of the Goſpel, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall of fundamentalls. That ſubſtantiall truth which almoſt all the types in the Law prefigured; that cardinall truth upon which dependeth the reſt of the Goſpel. This doctrine containeth <hi>good tydings of great joy which ſhall be to all people.</hi> Luke 2.10. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in my text, is I conceive, the ſame that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Here are tydings worthy to be received with full, with compleat acceptation. One ſoul is more precious then the fabrick of the world; certainly each mans ſoul ought to be more dear to him, as the principall part of himſelf. <hi>What will it profit a man, if he ſhall gain the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110803:48"/>
whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Mark 8.36, 37.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the ſoul is more precious then all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honours, treaſures and delight, ſo ſalvation is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ſoul. That which is the happineſſe, the end of man, muſt needs be better then man. Grace is better then nature. An habite is <hi>extremum potentiae.</hi> But our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is better then grace. It's better not to be, then to be eternally miſerable; and the fruition of God is much above our beings, and means conducing to it. There's a wide <hi>hiatus,</hi> a vaſt gulf between the largeſt of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſings and the narroweſt of ſpirituall conferred upon Gods children. Thoſe have an intereſt in one who knoweth all their wants, who is ready and able to help upon all occaſions. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous; and his ears are open unto their cry,</hi> Pſalme 34.15. Should not God ſee, as well as heare, his children ſhould want many things. We appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not all our own wants, and ſo cannot pray to God for the releif of all. God knoweth what we ſtand in need of, before we pray unto him, and of his own accord, (without any monitour) is wont to aid us. Gods favour likewiſe is conſtant. Acceptableneſſe with him is, (what Thucidides ſaid of a well compos'd hiſtory) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Our friends upon earth are oft times ignorant of our neceſſities; oft times impotent, not able to relieve us; ſometimes ſlack, and not forward to help; and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant. Temporal good things are ſcant cannot fill up the capacities of the ſoul. Neither is the underſtanding ſatisfied with humane knowledge, nor yet the will with worldly enjoyments. Nothing beſides God can quiet the mind.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The recovery of what hath been loſt, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioneth more joy then doth immunity from dammage. So much is expreſſed in three ſeverall parables, (Luke 15.) one of <hi>the loſt ſheep,</hi> a ſecond of <hi>the loſt great,</hi> a third of <hi>the prodigall ſonne. There's joy in heaven over one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:110803:48"/>
that repenteth, more then over ninety nine juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who need not repentance,</hi> Luke 15.7. God's more glorified in the converſion of ſinners, then he could have been by man perſiſting in integre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity. Converts have much more reaſon of rejoycing, then they ſhould have had, had they never fallen. We reflect with joy upon evils, which we have eſcaped. <hi>Hac olim m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>miniſſe juvabit.</hi> And our joy beareth proportion to our dangers. That our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be inlarg'd in ſpirituall joy and thankfullneſſe, God hath appointed out of his rich wiſdome the Law a School-maſter to ſcourge us to Chriſt. Dives was right for the ſubſtance of his requeſt, containing his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brethren yet living. A taſt of hell much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth to us the delights of heaven. S. Paul, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore, is a very pregnant example to this purpoſe. But moreover the glad tidings preach'd by S. Paul are worthy to be accepted by all men, as well as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all acceptation. The moſt righteous among men, Chriſt himſelf excepted, ſtand in need of a Saviour. It's juſt, (that I may borrow a ſentence from Euripides) that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who do what is not good ſuffer what is not delightfull. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. (ſaith Herodotus in his Terpſicore) <hi>Nullus homo poenam ſceleris reus effugit unquam.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as we all have ſinned, 'tis neceſſary that we all ſuffer in our own perſons, or ſome other for us. God the Sonne took upon him <hi>ſceleris noſtri expiandi partes,</hi> was pleaſed to become our Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt came into the world,</hi> is a doctrine as true as acceptable. Its an honourable truth, an axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome in faith. The words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> expreſſe as much; if we admit they are an exegeſis of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the epithite of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For proof of the Theſis, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, 1. To direct and immediate expreſſions in ſacred Scripture. 2. To Chriſts ſufferings. 3. To means added for the converſion of ſinners. 4. To the conſciences of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110803:49"/>
ſanctified men, thoſe who are moſt ſincere in their lives, and moſt competent judges. 5. To the prevalency of this doctrine over the power of darkneſſe, over errours and hereſies in mens judgements, perverſeneſſe in their wills and affections, and corruption in their lives.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the firſt. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes,</hi> Matth. 1.21. To ſave from ſinne, is to ſave from ſinne together with its evil conſequents. <hi>The Sonne of man is come to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> Matth. 8.11. He came to ſave thoſe who had gone aſtray, thoſe that were ſonnes of perdition, and to ſave them ſo as they ſhould become loſt in their own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. <hi>For God ſent not his Sonne into the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the world: but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 3.17. Here's deliverance from the ſad effects of ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> riddance from pain, and a reſtoring to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. I may adde, that thoſe who receive Chriſt, obtain a better condition then that which we loſt in our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; <hi>Felix lapſus qui talem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, let us take a ſurvey of Chriſts ſufferings. God the Father covenanted with the Sonne, that for his ſufferings <hi>he ſhould ſee his ſeed.</hi> Chriſt was the ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, by way of repreſentation a publick perſon. S. Auguſt. is clear to this purpoſe: <hi>Primus homo Adam ſic olim de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functus eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ut tamen poſt illum ſecundus homo ſit Chriſtus; cum tot hominum millia inter illum &amp; hunc or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſunt: &amp; ideo manifeſtum eſt pertinere ad illum omnem qui ex illa ſucceſſione propagatus naſcitur; ſicut ad iſtum pertinet omnis qui gratiae largitate in illo naſcitur. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde fit ut totum genus humanum quodammodo ſint hominis duo, primus &amp; ſecundus.</hi> Our Saviour is oft called <hi>the ſonne of man,</hi> that is, of Adam. Ezechiel with the Septuagint is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but Chriſt is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, the ſonne of the firſt (Adam) man. He was the next, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110803:49"/>

Had himſelf been created, or the ſonne of ſome one beſides Adam created, either God through him ſhould have been reconcileable towards ſome who ſinned, not ſuffering, or ſome ſhould have wanted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to Chriſts merits.

This branch offered up to God ſanctifieth the tree. Chriſt declared abundantly that <hi>he came to ſave ſinners,</hi> by what he ſuffered for them. He ſuffered for us what ſatisfied divine juſtice. <hi>In burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices for ſinne thou hadst no pleaſure: Then ſaid I, Lo I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10.6, 7.

The ſunne of righteouſneſſe (as Pelbartus alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorizing Gods covenant ſignified by the rainbow) falling into a cloud of paſſion, is our ſecurity againſt a deluge of damnation. Chriſt, as he came, ſo he overcame. He loſt not his labour: God cannot be fruſtrated in his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. As we may ſafely believe God in regard of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:110803:50"/>
(or truth), ſo we may ſafely hope in him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his power and authority to perform what at any time he promiſeth. He paid a price ſufficient for ſinnes at all times committed, although his merits become efficacious onely to thoſe who believe. Sufferings are wont to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed according to the value of perſons who undergo them; as what a Magiſtrate ſuffereth, much more then what a private perſon. But neither did our Saviour redeem us at a low rate; He was pleas'd to demonſtrate his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, by ſuſtaining the wrath of God, and ſhedding his moſt precious bloud for us.

            <p>Our Saviours ſufferings were much ſharpened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered by circumſtances. 1. He was betrayed of one of his diſciples. 2.

We may here take notice of the omnipotency of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdome, which is wont to abuſe mens malicious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Mens wicked plots and contrivances improv'd by Gods wiſe ſuperintendency become ecſtaticall, produce ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and iſſues above their own ſphere, beſides their own nature.

            </p>
            <p>Sacraments uſed by Gods people before &amp; under the Law, looked forward, as theſe now uſed by Chriſtians backward to Chriſt. The Paſſeover and the Euchariſt are pregnant reſemblances both of what Chriſt ſuffered for us, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of what benefit we receive from him.<note n="*" place="margin">See Beza upon Acts 15.20. 1. Cor. 10.18. &amp; 21.</note> Beza is right, as conceiving that <hi>the cup of devils,</hi> and <hi>the table of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> (1. Cor, 10.21.) were an appendix of idololatricall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, a feaſt in which idolaters partaked of the altar; and that the <hi>cup of the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>table of the Lord,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of analogy was fitly oppoſed to <hi>the cup of devils</hi> and <hi>the table of devils:</hi> yet foraſmuch as tranſubſtantiation is impoſſible, there muſt needs be much diſſimilitude between the ſacrificiall feaſts of heathens, and the Lords Supper, as compared to ſacrifices whereof they were appendices. The bread and wine which Chriſtians receive in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, are not materially, but onely repreſentatively the ſame thing which was ſacrificed for us. The Lords Supper when firſt inſtituted by Chriſt, reſembled what he intended to do for us, and ſince his paſſion is a commemorative ſigne of his ſufferings: Chriſt had not yet offered up himſelf, when he inſtituted the Euchariſt, &amp; adminiſtred it to his diſciples. He inſtructs the then preſent, and enſuing ages, that no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation is to be imagined, by injoyning that this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhould be perform'd <hi>in remembrance of him,</hi> Luke 22.29. 1. Cor. 11.24, 25. Circumciſion and baptiſme ſet before us what Chriſt underwent for us, rather as in its effects, then as in it ſelf. That any are circumciſed in the inward man. waſh'd from the pollution and guilt of ſinne, is wholly to be attributed to Chriſts merits. In circumciſion bloud was ſhed; both bloud and water ſtreamed out of our Saviours ſide. He is the fountain of all true Sacraments. Moſes by Zipporah is call'd <hi>ſponſus ſanguinum,</hi> (Exod. 4.25.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his life was ſaved by the circumciſion of his ſonne. <hi>An husband of bloud art thou to me,</hi> is tranſlated in On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelus,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110803:51"/>
               <hi>For the bloud of this circumciſion my husband is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me.</hi> He paraphraſeth thus upon the latter part of the verſe following, <hi>But for the bloud of this circumciſion my husband muſt needs have been killed.</hi> The Arabick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the Pentateuch, made publick by Erpenius, upon that comma in the fourth of Exodus, may be conſtrued by this Latine; <hi>Et arripuit Tſeforah petram, &amp; abſcidit prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putium filii ſui, &amp; oſtendit inter manus ſuas, &amp; dixit, Quia ſponſus occiſus tu mihi.</hi> The ſenſe here is the ſame clearly, that before in the Chaldee. Zipporah circumciſed her ſonne, becauſe her husband was but as a dead man, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe had been ſlain.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath plentifully demonſtrated that he <hi>came to ſave ſinners,</hi> by means which he uſeth that he may make them partakers of his merits. He uſeth, ſaith Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus in his <hi>Paedagog. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="8">8. Chriſt lamenteth the death of ſinners. Chriſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the folly of Jeruſalem, which <hi>would not take notice of the day of her viſitation.</hi>

            <p n="9">9. Chriſt in the Sacraments which he injoyned us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendeth to our earthly apprehenſions, rendreth his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe viſible, ſetteth ſalvation before our eyes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. God writeth his laws in the hearts of his elect, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth them to perform what he requireth from them, to believe, to repent, to obſerve in ſome meaſure each pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Morall Law.

Hence it appeareth <hi>that he came to ſave ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the conſciences of Gods children atteſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly the truth of this doctrine. <hi>God hath ſealed them, and given them the earneſt of the ſpirit in their hearts,</hi> 2. Cor. 1.22. and 5.5. Epheſ. 1.13. Theſe Scriptures (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) do not onely concern the preachers of the Goſpel, but exhibite to us the condition likewiſe of other believers. 1. God immediately inclineth his children to rely upon his goodneſſe and free mercy. 2. He teacheth them to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of him, as well as to expect good from him; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him in duties of both tables. They have experience of reformation in themſelves, which they know to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſtrength of nature. They know it to be as impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them ſo to reform themſelves, <hi>as for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle.</hi> They perhaps alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conceiv'd (their affections rendring their judgements partiall) that victory over ſome luſt or other, was above the power of ordinary grace, or at leaſt thought that they ſhould one day periſh under this or that corruption. How great a change is wrought in their ſouls, we may judge from that of the Prophet Eſay, chap. 11.6. <hi>The wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the lambe, and the leopard ſhall ly down with the kid: and the calf and the yong lion, and the fatling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and a little child ſhall lead them.</hi> We know how hard a task it is to change what's naturall. <hi>Can the leopard change his ſpots, or the blackamore his skin.</hi> It's more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to change nature it ſelf. Water may for ſome time looſe coldneſſe, a quality naturall to it, ſo as it may retain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110803:52"/>
its nature. Gods children are born again by regeneration, and made partakers of a new nature. Grace wrought in the heart is a pledge of ſalvation, the firſt fruits of heaven. This gracious reformation whereof Chriſtians have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, was purchaſed hy Chriſts merits. Firſt, it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Chriſts death and reſurrection. We may oft by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lineaments in children diſcern their parents. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Goſpel is the great power of God to converſion. The converſion of ſouls is above created ſtrength, and God is not wont to cooperate with falſe means. The Goſpel directeth us to Chriſt, as the fountain of grace and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What Manilius fabulouſly reporteth of Orpheus, is true of Chriſt. <q>
                  <l>Et ſenſus ſcopulis, &amp; ſylvis addidit aures,</l>
                  <l>Et Diti lacrymas &amp; morti denique finem.</l>
               </q>
Chriſt, (that I may omit Sozomen reporting that a tree in Egypt bowed it ſelf in honour to our Saviour there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; which ſtory, or rather fiction, Scultetus alſo mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>exercit. evangel. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 59.) moveth ſtocks and ſtones, our ſtupid and ſtony hearts. Here's alſo <hi>finis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the death of death. The remnant of the diſtich quoted out of Manilius <hi>(&amp; Diti lacrymas)</hi> is capable of ſuch an interpretation as may illuſtrate another argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz.</hi> that the prevalency of the Goſpel over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans kingdome, demonſtrates <hi>that Christ came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> That the Goſpel hath prevailed over perverſneſſe in mens wills and affections, and corruption in their lives, is evident to the conſciences of believers, and oft acknowledged by profane perſons. Many who will not themſelves have Chriſt to rule over them (ſonnes of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) perceive and confeſſe in others the powers of godlineſſe.

Behold, we have heard that there is ſpirituall food in ſuch or ſuch a countrey, let us remove thither that our ſouls may live, and not die.</hi>

We may learn who receive Chriſt aright, and likewiſe be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo to receive him, from John 1.12, 13. <hi>But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſonnes of God; even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Thoſe who receive Chriſt aright, are not overſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by naturall corruptions, nor yet by the commandments of men; moreover attain ſomewhat both beyond the reach of nature and education, are by regeneration conformed to Gods will.<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Field</hi> concerning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall degrees of Love, in the Apendix to his third book <hi>of the Church,</hi> chap. 5</note> They embrace Chriſt not onely as a Prieſt offering up himſelf for their ſinnes, but likewiſe as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to direct them, and as a King to rule over them.

               </gap>) floweth with riches. One drop of it is enough to enrich thouſands of worlds to all eternity. Uranople <hi>(the new Jeruſalem) hath its foundations garniſhed with all manner of precious ſtones,</hi> Apocalyp. 21.19.

ſome time or other each truth will obtain au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. When any of us is in danger of death, or at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt immediately after death, S. Pauls doctrine will be confeſſed worthy of all acceptation. All who have heard it, and not received it, will acknowledge themſelves fools at the day of judgement.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us offer up all poſſible praiſe, honour, glory, and thankfulneſſe to the ſacred Trinity contriving ſuch a way for our recovery; to God the Father who gave <hi>his onely begotten Sonne, in whom he was well pleaſed,</hi> to be a ranſome for us; to God the Sonne who <hi>ſuffered an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death for us;</hi> to that Spirit which ſanctifieth us. Let us propagate our thankfulneſſe into our lives: Let us not think any peice of ſelf-deniall, any ſervice too deare for God. Chriſt hath deſcended lower for us then 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to debaſe our ſelves for him. The ſaints upon earth ſing a new ſong in the honour of Chriſt; <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof: For thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy bloud, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation,</hi> Rev. 5.9, 10. Heaven anſwers as by an eccho, the muſick upon earth in the mean time continuing, verſe 11, 12. <hi>Worthy is the Lambe that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdome, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing.</hi> This ſong of Angels putteth Chriſt in the third perſon. He took not upon him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: He is nearer to us. All creatures come in as the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, v. 13. <hi>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying, Bleſſing, honour, glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lambe for ever and ever.</hi> As man began, ſo he concludes the ſong, v. 14. <hi>And the foure li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures ſaid, Amen. And the foure and twenty Elders fell down and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:110803:54"/>Becauſe there are ſeverall degrees of thankfulneſſe, I ſhall adde to theſe examples, ſome motives, which may quicken us in the duties mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are unable in our own perſons to fulfill the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law. Let us exceed the Scribes and Phariſees, who ſo farre relyed upon ſelf-ſufficiency, that they conceiv'd the Goſpel in regard of themſelves impertinent doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Could we avoid all actuall tranſgreſſions, yet origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is able to damn us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No one merely a creature can ſupererogate, can ſpare us any part of his obedience. The bleſſed Angels, of all creatures moſt nimble and cheerfull in obedience, have oyl little enough in their lamps for themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. No one merely a creature, nor yet all creatures could by ſufferings redeem ſo much as one ſoul. They ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be ſuffering, but never ſatisfie. If any commend any other way to ſalvation, (as the fulfilling of the morall Law, the interceſſion of the Virgine Mary, &amp;c.) beſides Chriſt, that proverb mentioned by Ariſtotle in his Meteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologie is verified of him, viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>manus Chriſti</hi> (to wit, nailed to the croſſe) is the onely phyſick for a ſin-ſick ſoul. We ſtand in need (as you ſee) of Chriſts merits: but let us preferre ingenuity before neceſſity, let us expoſe our hearts to the woundings of a friend. Chriſt (as Anacreon upon a worſe occaſion) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Suffer his love to wound your hearts. Meditate returns anſwerable in ſome proportion to his ſufferings. Let us propagate our thankfulneſſe into our lives; and praiſe and honour God, by doing his will. So ſhall his will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Let none who maketh profeſſion of Chriſtianity, carry himſelf ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly. <hi>Muta nomen, vel age fortiús.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Foraſmuch as <hi>Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> and is a ſufficient Mediatour, able abundantly to ſave, let us not ſeek unto any other. Let us not go about to alienate any part of his office, to conferre honour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110803:55"/>
to him, upon ſaints, angels, or images. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaketh expreſſely, <hi>that in the later times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and the doctrine of daemons,</hi> 1. Tim. 4.1. Beza upon the laſt word of that comma thus commenteth: <hi>Notum eſt quid hoc nomine Platonici preſertim intellexerint: ſacri ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò ſcriptores noxios illos &amp; impuros ſpiritus ſic vocant.</hi> That <hi>opus poſt humum</hi> of a late judicious authour inſcrib'd, <hi>The Apoſtaſie of the later times,</hi> well preferreth the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that word <hi>daemons,</hi> which learned Beza ſeemeth to reject, and fully demonſtrates that Gods ſpirit hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned us in the Scripture now quoted, to beware of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours and Mediatreſſes forged by the Papiſts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. What Chriſt hath done for us calleth for ſpirituall rejoycing. <hi>And it ſhall be ſaid in that day, Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: this is the Lord we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoyce in his ſalvation,</hi> Eſay 25.9. The ſame motives which I commended to you in the fifth uſe, will likewiſe ſuggeſt ſpirits and alacrity in the performance of this duty. The Hollander, when he had obtained from Queen Elizabeth a promiſe of aſſiſtance againſt the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, took for a Motto, <hi>Luctor &amp; emergo.</hi> We may, ſith Chriſt hath ſo farre appeared for us, take for our word <hi>the name of the altar built by Moſes,</hi> Exod. 17.15. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>The Lord is my banner.</hi> What greater occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing then invincible ſalvation? God is the tower of the ſalvations of his anointed. What Chriſt hath purchaſed for us is ſufficiently fortified and ſecured. Thoſe cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated and disheartened by any evil tydings, and croſſe events upon earth, whoſe joy is heavenly.</p>
            <p n="8">8. S. Pauls doctrine chaſtiſeth thoſe who murmer and repine at the ſalvation of others.<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Socrat. Hiſt. Eccles. lib. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi>

            <p n="9">9. Let us endeavour the converſion of others, <hi>pull them out of the fire.</hi> Jude 23. God (as ye ſee) both by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and precept requireth this office from us. (And that I may ſuggeſt another incitement) what more rationall, then that we ſhould be ſubſervient to Gods ends. <hi>Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> then let us likewiſe endeavour their ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Let us walk charitably and compaſſionately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſuch as are capable of ſalvation, but more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>towards the houſhold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6.10. <hi>If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall treſpaſſe againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone,</hi> Matth. 18.15. <hi>Who ſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones, which believe in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea,</hi> Matt. 18.6. Beſides that men oft times aggravate ſmall faults, with Momus exclaim againſt the creaking of Venus her pantofle; and ſometimes impute crimes to thoſe in whoſe lives, in whoſe goings there is beſt harmony; to reprehend openly intimateth a greater diſaffection towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offending, then towards the offence. Neither is it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, not to be ill affected towards Gods children: We muſt ſympathize with our brethren in afflictions. Chriſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:110803:56"/>
did not onely ſympathize with, or ſuffer for his friends, but condeſcended to an accurſed death for his enemies.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Let us do good againſt evil. Chriſt came to ſave enemies. After his example <hi>bleſſe them that curſe you,</hi> perform good offices to thoſe who deſpitefully uſe you. Rom. 5.6, 8. 1. Cor. 8.11. 2. Cor. 5.14, 15. Men are wont to eſteem thoſe fools, and to brand them with this ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious name, who do good to their enemies, who when they are reviled reply not again. This part of honeſty is accounted folly. Solomons rule is out of date, viz. <hi>When a man is ſilent, he's to be reputed able to ſpeak.</hi> As drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe is veiled with the name of good fellowſhip, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe reckoned good husbandry, ſo pride is ordinarily applauded under the name of animoſity and a good ſpirit. I commend to your meditations, that Chriſt, when he was condemned, as he was led to be executed opened not his mouth by reviling his perſecutours, but by praying that their ſinne might not be laid to their charge.</p>

            <p>I am not able nor willing to give a catalogue of all thoſe empty curioſities, frothy conceits, ecſtaticall paradoxes, brain-ſick phanſies, Bethlehem ravings, which have been obtruded for truths authentick or fundamentall. I ſhall ſingle out ſome one or two, which may be here ſeaſonably chaſtized, as not permitting the circumſtantialls of Chriſts coming into the world to retain their due rank and order, but thruſting them forward into equipage with what is moſt ſubſtantiall in religion.</p>
            <p>One conceiveth that to misinterpret our Saviours two genealogies, (one of which, <hi>viz.</hi> that in Matthew chap. 1. contains his pedigree as he was <gap reason="foreign">

The falſity of this petty conceit is eaſily deprehended; but alſo ſome other may occaſion diſcourſe (as much as I may conveniently ſuperadde) more profitable.</p>
            <p>Another will fear, leaſt the hiſtory of Chriſts birth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the poſiture of the place in which he was born, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the parts of heaven (or the ſuperiour world), its longitude and latitude be duely atteſted, may in proceſſe of

time (in mens opinions) vaniſh into a fiction. Either expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience or reaſon (that I may not object the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture) might challenge a better opinion concerning ſucceeding ages. Its well known, that many have given full credit to divine ſtories, (who never conſulted with any map) who knew not in what parts of the world the ſcenes were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate. Many true believers are uncapable of ſuch knowledge. Sacred Scripture oft wholly omits the circumſtance of place.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not need to repeat here what hath been ſaid before againſt Aſtrologers, who have imagined that the time of God the Sonne incarnated, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the ſtarres. I could wiſh that none out-ſtrip'd them in madneſſe and blaſphemy. Thoſe conceive, ſome of them, that God hath deſign'd the ſtarres for harbingers of what he intendeth to bring to paſſe in the ſublunary world; others who aſcribe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> efficacy above their ſphere of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, acknowledge that it was conferred upon them by God. To ſubordinate an eternall God to time, to make omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency depend upon times and ſeaſons, to affirm that God could not ſooner or later have perform'd what was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the redemption of ſinfull men, that he could not but effect what things were done or ſuffered for us, at what times they were accompliſhed, farre ſurpaſſeth the wildeſt conceits of vaineſt Aſtrologers. No one who is <hi>compos ſui,</hi> will imagine that God more depended upon time for the union of the two natures of Chriſt, or his ſuffering death for us, then in the creation of the world.

I conceive there was no arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall motion before man was created: but certainly there was naturall, at leaſtwiſe of the firmament, or of the earth. Whether or no Angels are able to comprehend the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things permanent, without ſome meaſure applyed, or extrinſecall time, I ſhall not need to determine. Moneths and years (moſt properly ſo called) are the ſame with the proper motions of the Moon and Sun. We owe dayes (whether naturall or artificiall) as they denote time, to the motion of the earth; or elſe to the common, or participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (that I may ſo ſpeak with Philoſophers) motion of the Sunne. <hi>Time</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>eternity</hi> (which limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I inſert, as knowing how largely ſome late authours have uſed the word) neceſſarily ſucceeded (it's exiſtence ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) in order of nature, ſomewhat created. It is clear that time depended upon the Creation, not God about to create the world upon time. Old Saturn ſhould now be more aged, had God been pleaſed to have anticipated the creation.

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:110803:63"/>The next joynt of time is leſſe knotty, yet not wholly exempted from perplexity.

The 430. years mentioned, Exod. 12.40. are the ſame with theſe, onely 50. dayes interceded between the departure of the Iſraelites from Egypt and the Law given on Sinai, a number not conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Whereas we read in our Engliſh tranſlation for that text of Exodus quoted, <hi>the dwelling of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, while they dwelled in Egypt, was</hi> 430. <hi>years,</hi> we ought thus (as doth Maſter Ainſworth) to tranſlate the originall: <hi>The dwelling of the ſonnes of Iſrael who dwelt in Egypt was</hi> 430. <hi>years.

the children of Iſrael. Their fathers, as farre as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, are are to be taken in. We may together with the ſonnes of Iſrael, as well comprehend their fathers as their ſiſters. Onkelus in his Chaldee paraphraſe, exactly expreſſeth the Hebrew, but is as unhappily tranſlated into Latine, as the Hebrew into Engliſh. The article, which ought to be referred to the children of Iſrael, is unduly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their peregrination, and ſo their peregrination wholly related to Egypt. The 72. interpreters, (in which, the dwelling of the ſonnes of Iſrael, which they and their fathers dwelt in the land of Egypt, and the land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, are 430. years,) apprehended the true ſenſe. Theſe 430. years added to 2083. preceding, (according to M. Broughtons accompt,) complete 2513. The 400. years, in which Abrahams ſeed ſhould be evil entreated, (Gen. 15.13. Acts 7.6. are to be reckoned from the time, in which Iſmael the ſonne of Egyptirn Hagar, began to afflict Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac. Iſaac, when ſix years old, might underſtand Iſmael mocking him. We muſt not conceive that all intermiſſion of afflictions, and <hi>Lucida intervalla,</hi> are to be excluded from theſe 400. years. The whole diſtance between the beginning and the end is to be attended.</p>
            <p>From the children of Iſrael coming out of Egypt, to the building of the temple, were 480 years. (1. Kings 6.1.) Theſe added to Broughtons 2513.) preceding, make up 2993. I ſhould omit leſſer numbers (mentioned in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture) of which the 480. years, (in the firſt of the ſixt of the firſt of Kings,) are compounded, did not the twentieth verſe of the thirteenth of the Acts, ſuggeſt a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be removed.

            <p>The years for offenders are expreſſed in ſix texts of the book of Judges; for Chuſan, 8. (Judges 3.8.) Eglon, 18. (Judges 3.14.) Siſera, 20. (Judges 4.3.) Midian, 7. (Judg. 6.1.) Ammon, 18. (Judg. 10.8.) Philiſtines, 40. (Judg. 13.1.) the totall ſumme is 111.</p>
            <p>We find in Judges twelve places for the defenders of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. So many particular numbers of years for them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 299; which Elies 40. years make up 339. Theſe added to 111. make up the number afore-mentioned in the Acts. The times of Iſraels afflictions mentioned in the book of Judges, are contained (as the learned Authour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready praiſ'd conceivs) in times given to defenders. Their Judges came ſometimes by the worſe. Yet in the 13. of the Acts, after what manner ſome ſegments of a line to the whole) are added to the whole time between Joſhuah and Samuel. Maſter Broughtons wit perhaps in this conceit is to be preferred before his judgement. Some places in Judges ſeem clearly to intimate, that the times of ſufferings were not comprehended in the years attributed to thoſe who judged Iſrael.

(or 70. Dan. 9.24.) His ſeventy weeks and an half, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 493. years and an half: the beginning of which he reckons from the ſecond yeare of Darius Nothus, that is, from the 4290. in the Julian period; the end of them in the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, in the 4783. of the Julian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>

Longimanus, between which and Chriſts paſſion he accompts 490. years.</p>
            <p>Some terminate 70. weeks in the beginning of Herods kingdome, that is, (according to Scaliger) in the 4675. yeare of the <hi>Julian</hi> period, from which the 490. backward, will fall into the 4187. yeare of the ſame accompt, and (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame authour) into the ſecond of Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Munſter conjectures, that the ſeventy weeks ſucceed immediately the 70 years captivity, and are terminated in the beginning of Herods kingdome. Herod (as Scaliger computes) reign'd 37. years before the nativity of the Meſſiah. Maſter Huit in's comment upon Daniel, placeth the beginning of the ſeventy weeks in the firſt yeare of Cyrus, conceivs the end of them was the beginning of the Gentiles called, and Jews rejected.

            <p>Iſraelites who lived between the ſeventy years captivity and the birth of the Meſſiah, might receive comfort from Daniels prophecy, although uncertain concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of events foretold.

Karites, to make many (but ſo as the number ſhould not exceed foure,) complete moneths together.

            <p>Why Jews anciently, whether Talmudiſts or Karites, did not rather expect the phaſis on the 29. then on the 30. night after a full moneth, I cannot divine. Although the phaſis, ſhould no groſſe body be interpoſed, between mans ſight and the place of the moon in the skie, obſerve not alwayes the ſame diſtance from a conjunction, yet there ſeems to be the ſame reaſon of expecting the appearance of the moon in the 29. night after a ſolid moneth, and on the 30. after an hollow moneth. Neither do I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what hindred them, whether after a moneth of 29. or 30. dayes from beginning a new moneth from the firſt appearance of the moon after a conjunction, although it happened before the 29. day.</p>
            <p>It remaineth that I explain, when Karites conceive the beginning of the moneth, or Neomenia, began firſt to be reckoned from the firſt phaſis of the moon after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; or if the moon was not ſeen in the night imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceeding the 29. of the moneth, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next following, &amp;c. or yet where Talmudiſts fix the Epocha of their manner of accompting before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, not much diſtinct from that of the Karites.</p>

Perhaps they thought they were for ſome time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The 150. dayes mentioned Gen. 7.24. and chap. 8.3. they conceive to have for their Epocha the 17. day of the ſecond moneth (which they ſuppoſe to have been Jiar) on which Noah entred into the Ark, and to expire at the end of the ſeventeenth day of the ſeventh moneth, on which the ark reſted on the mountains of Ararat. If Jiar and the foure moneths next following had all been ſolide, the ſumme ſhould have been 151. dayes.

I have now ſummarily repreſented what is moſt ſolid and ſincere in Scaligers arguments, for the Calippicall period uſed by the Jews in our Saviours time.

               </gap> are capable.</p>
            <p>In his chapter <hi>de anno Judaorum novitio (lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 121.) he intimateth how long he thought the Jews retain'd the Calippicall period, <hi>viz.</hi> till the vulgar yeare of Chriſt 344. <hi>qui erat Seleucidarum</hi> 656. <hi>&amp; quadrageſimus octavus poſt duas periodos Hipparcheas.</hi> Then (he ſaith) the Jews appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended their errour, <hi>viz.</hi> that the beginning of the yeare was protruded the ſpace of two dayes (beſides houres and ſcruples).

            <p>I cannot but obſerve that R. Adda contributeth little to the ſupporting of Scaligers opinion. Scaliger never ſaw any work of this Authour, onely learned from * R. Haie a Spaniard, his judgement concerning the ſolar yeare. Beſides that, the Talmudiſts conceive that the Jews were no where bound to obſerve the phaſis of the moon in order to the beginning of their moneths, but in the holy land; nor there longer then there remained a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin among them, it implieth no contradiction that thoſe ſhould expreſſe their opinions concerning ſolar years, who for the epochaes of the moneth attended to the phaſis, and and whoſe civill years were not ſolar.</p>
            <p>The Talmudiſts alſo witneſſe, that the Jews by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calations, provided that their feaſts ſhould return each of them about the ſame time of the ſolar year.</p>
            <p>Scaliger acknowledgeth that 76 years, ſuch as are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by R. Adda, were by a quadrante of a day, leſſe then Calippus his period. R. Ada's laſt fraction might poſſibly intimate no more then that he deſcribed a yeare as part of a quadrant of Hipparchus his period. R. Ada ſeemeth rather to have ſuggeſted a new way of computation to the Jews, then to have reported what was their manner of accompt. His endeavour afterward took effect. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Joſephus his teſtimonies cited by Scaliger, at moſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade, do not prove what he thence concluded. Feaſts might ſometimes fall out on the ſame dayes of weeks or moneths, according to an uncertain, as according to a cyclicall accompt. He ſubſtracteth a yeare from 27. aſſign'd by Joſephus to the ſpace between Jeruſalem taken by Pompey, and afterwards by Soſius. Perhaps ſhould any conceive it <hi>operae pretium,</hi> he might find more inſtances diſſonant, then Scaliger produceth as agreeable to his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Jewiſh cyclicall computation. But moreover any indifferent judge will readily give ſentence, that Scaliger, unleſſe he was reſolv'd to diſſemble his skill in hiſtory, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vined that the Jews, before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem us'd the Calyppicall period. I ſhall not need after Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, to explain what violence he offered to Joſephus. Moſt certain it is that Scaligers invention much out-pas'd his judgement. He might by his skill in languages have much advanc'd the Literarie Republick, had he not more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected to ſhew himſelf wittie, then judicious.

In years which have a moneth inſerted, Adar is doubled: The firſt hath 30. the other 29. dayes.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take occaſion here to correct an errour, which hath been propagated by this authour. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that no moneth but the laſt could be doubled <hi>in anno emboliſmaeo</hi> without violation of the Scripture;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:110803:78"/>
becauſe the moneths there have their order aſſigned them, (he maketh particular mention of Adar, <hi>viz. it is ſaid to be the twelfth moneth</hi>) yet acknowledgeth that the firſt Adar is the moneth intercalated. The laſt Adar hath been miſtaken by ſome late Writers for the moneth intercalated. Neither may I omit that the Authour praiſed is inconſiſtent with himſelf, as in ſeverall places defining the extent of the intercalated moneth to be 29. dayes, 12. houres, 795. ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, (which is the quantity of common moneths) yet elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where making it 30. dayes. This perplexity is not peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to this authour. It's agreed that the intercalated Adar had 30. dayes, yet 29. dayes and 12. houres ſubſtracted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times from the exceſſe of the Solar enneadecaeteris compared with the Lunar, leaveth but one houre and 485. ſcruples. What more was requiſite to the filling up of 7. intercalated moneths, was ſubducted (I conjecture) from the houres and parts of houres by which lunary years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded 354. dayes.</p>
            <p>The 12. houres of each lunary moneth above 29. dayes, multiplied by 12. make 6. dayes, which are diſpoſed of each yeare<note n="*" place="margin">The 30. day of a full mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth is <gap reason="foreign">

The ſcruples of a moneth beſides complete dayes and houres, <hi>viz.</hi> 793. multiplied by 12. make 9516. that is, 8. houres, 876. ſcruples.

But part of them, (as I ſaid) ſeem to have completed intercalated moneths. According to the authour before quoted, Marcheſchvan, which is naturally an hollow moneth, is ſometimes made full, and Ciſleu which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:110803:79"/>
a full moneth, is ſometimes made hollow, by reaſon of tranſlation of feaſts.</p>
            <p>What ſome other writers deliver about the Epocha of the Jewiſh moneth, by it ſelf much perplexed, is extrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from difficulty by what I have produced out of the book <hi>de Neomeniis &amp; Tecuphis.</hi> Among ſeverall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Latine authours, who expreſſe themſelves in this point alike, I ſhall make choice of Abarbinel for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but ſhall explain likewiſe what he thought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times before the Exodus.</p>

Five moneths (ſaith he) are perpetually full (each of them of 30. dayes,) five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually hollow (each of them of 29. dayes) and two moneths, <hi>viz.</hi> Marcheſchvan and Ciſleu ſometimes have each of them 30. dayes, ſometimes each of them but 29. dayes. He affirmeth that the neomenia (or beginning of the moneth) was faſtened by computation from the dayes of Moſes to Antigonus; and that Antigonus his two ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars Sadoc and Baitus (ring-leaders to the ſect of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, whom that faction of the Jews, which are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Karites, ſucceed in moſt of their opinions) firſt taught that the beginning of the moneth ought to be ratified by the phaſis. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>R. Gamaliel (he ſaith) had ſhapes of moons upon his wall, in order to the inſtruction of his ſcholars, and the ſectatours of Sadoc and Baitus. The times of Jewiſh feſtivalls (according to the ſame authour) were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by by the Sanhedrin; but according to computation, not according to the phaſis.

            <p>Epiphanius in his 51. Hereſie (intituled <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that the Jews in our Saviours time uſed a double cycle, a leſſer of 14. years, a greater of 85. years. Simple years, that is, ſuch as had nothing intercalated, contained each of them 354. dayes, and foure houres, ſuch as were 1/3. of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. In each Teſſaradecaeteris five moneths were intercalated.</p>
            <p>The greater cycle according to the Chetib in Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, contained 85 years. One moneth, (beſides the five of each leſſer cycle) was intercalated in the 85. yeare. Their civil years ought to reconcile the motions of the ſunne and moon, as farre as they conceived it poſſible, within the compaſſe of the greater cycle. Some perhaps attending that Cyrill maketh mention of a cycle of 84 years uſed by ſome Chriſtians, or regarding the proportion between 84 and 14 (the number of years in Epiphanius his leſſer cycle) which is exactly ſextuple, have derogated a yeare from Epiphanius his greater Jewiſh cycle. The Jews (ſaith Epiphanius) in 85 years intercalated 31 moneths,<note n="*" place="margin">Petitus thus readeth the end of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius his paragraph touching the Jewiſh cycles.</note>

The Neomenia of Niſan in the 86<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. yeare, was protruded two dayes by the default of their cycle. But the 27 dayes and 22 houres might be compleated into a moneth, by the exceſſe of Lunary years above 354. dayes, 8. houres. The meaſure of the Lunar yeare according to our Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours is 354. dayes, 8. houres, 876. ſcruples. Thoſe who had the managing of the Jewiſh accompt, might conceal from the vulgar the 876 ſcruples which were to 354. dayes, 8. houres, the complement in the lunar yeare, yet oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely intercalate them.</p>

            <p>Abarbinels opinion (as it's clear from what I cited out of him) is almoſt diametrally oppoſite.

It's probable enough that ſome later writers, whether Jews or of any other nation, might underſtand what maximes were delivered by authours more ancient touching the Hebrews aſtronomicall or civill accompt of preſent ages, to be ſpoken of the civill accompt of ages preceding.

on the 30. day, (reckoned from the laſt neomenia,) by intercalating a day made the moneth full, or of 30. dayes, and decreed that the 31. day ſhould be the epocha of the next moneth; but if after foure or five dayes, or at the end of the moneth (Niſan and Tiſri being excepted) it were confirm'd to them by ſufficient teſtimonies, that the moon had been ſeen at her time (<hi>viz.</hi> on the 30. night) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reckon the 30. day the beginning of the moneth.

            <p>Petitus conceiveth, that the Jews before the Haloſis of jeruſalem had a cycle of eight years, and in the ſame times their accompt according to the phaſis.

            <p>The Iſraelites underſtood by the Prophet Moſes, that God had ſign'd them a diſpenſation for the ſpoyling of the Egyptians. God by his Prophets and Apoſtles added other ſacred Scriptures to the Pentateuch. Theſe were enabled by a Schechina. The high Prieſts gave anſwers by Urim and Thummim. I cannot doubt but God oft by a Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china taught the Senatours judgement. But neither can I believe that divine aſſiſtance and infallibility were entayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Sanhedrin. We are ſufficiently inform'd that it was otherwiſe in our Saviours time. It's credible enough that our Saviour, if the moon appear'd at her time, and the time of her appearance ought to be counted the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the moneth, would give notice of the Phaſis. The Sanhedrin perhaps neare the time of our Saviours paſſion, might refuſe due teſtimonies of the moon's appearance on the 30. day; or elſe judge it neceſſary that a day ſhould be inſerted.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Karites (as Abarbinel witneſſeth) have a cycle of 19. years, to which by emboliſmes they conform their uncertain accompt.</p>
            <p>I may here opportunely give notice, that Maimon. in his interpretation of the firſt Perech of Roſch Haſſchana in part excepteth Elul and Tiſri from the rules of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain accompt. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:110803:86"/>
to give notice of the neomenia of Elul to thoſe who were diſtant, that they might obſerve the beginning of the yeare at due time. Maimonides commenteth upon this part of the text in theſe words: <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If ſuch an uncertain computation as hath been ſpoken of, obtained for any ſegment of time, we cannot by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of Jewiſh years, comprehend the diſtance of events between which it interceded.

            <p>Saul and Jonathan and David (1. Sam. 20.) knew that the next day ſhould be the new moon, yet could not divine that the moon ſhould appear in the night following. Their knowledge might be merely conjecturall; or they might be certain that the morrow ſhould be the new moon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their expectation of the phaſis was fruſtrated in the night preceding.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe is ſatisfied, if (as Abarbinel ſeemeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) the ſanction of the Neomenia by the Phaſis began to be uſed publickly in the times of Sadoc and Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. But moreover, thoſe authours who affirm that the Jews alwayes uſed a cyclicall accompt, are ſo many, and ſo much differ in their opinions, that although the uncertain accompt teſtified by the Talmudiſts and Karites, was quite expunged, we ſhould remain doubtfull about ſacred Chonology.</p>
            <p>I cannot believe that the phaſis of the moon was, as the Karites affirm, the epocha of the moneth in the age of the floud; nor with Eliah Ben Moſeh one of that ſect, that Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan was then the firſt of moneths; nor yet that the meaſure of years mentioned in Geneſis, is ſufficiently known to us. <hi>Honore, exiſtimatione, authoritate, utì &amp; vetuſtate Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudicos Karitis nunquam non praecelluiſſe ſatis eſt rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum.</hi> Thus M.

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:110803:90"/>It remains that I relate what the Talmudiſts deliver concerning moneths, for the times before the deliverance from Egypt.</p>
            <p>Aben Ezra upon Exod. 12. telleth us that we find in in Scripture onely three names of moneths, Zif, Ethanim, Bul, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in the holy language (or Hebrew) that the reſt are (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in the language of the Caldeans; and occurre onely in Zachary, Daniel, Ezra, and Heſter (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) who were in the captivity. That moneth which was the firſt of the yeare before the deliverance of the Iſraelites from Egypt, (afterwards cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tiſri) is named Ethanim, 1. Kings 8.2. that which was the ſecond (ſince called Marcheſchvan) is Bul, 1. Kings 6.38. And the eighth (now called Jiar) is Zif, 1. King. 6.1. Some (I know) have thought that Abib was the proper name of a moneth; but Aben Ezra diſſenteth from them in the place quoted, and juſtly, unleſſe R. D. Kimchi in's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher haſchoraſchim, and Elias Levita in's Methurgeman, be defective in their explications of the word Abib. The word muſt needs be otherwiſe conſtrued, in Lev. 2.14. we have mention of a ſecond moneth; Gen. 7.11. and 8.14. of a ſeventh moneth, Gen. 8.4. of a tenth, v. 5. of a firſt moneth, v. 13. Moſes in his Chronology of the floud, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was directed to write in the dialect of the age in which the floud happened. It's impoſſible to prove that in thoſe times moneths were otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed, then by numbers expreſſing their order.</p>

            <p>It's clear, that had the civill moneths in the age of the floud been conform'd as near as 'twas poſſible, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances between conjunctions, Eliezer and Raſi, &amp;c. were much to be preferred before theſe laſt quoted.

But it's ſufficiently known, that the civill moneths of moſt nations anciently, as do the Julian one excepted, exceeded the ſpace between conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

            <p>About moneths there are (as I have ſhewed) three opinions, into which the Hebrew Doctours are parted, one of the Karites, and two of the Talmudiſts.</p>
            <p>The Karites who would obtrude upon the times before the Exodus, their uncertain accompt are overpowred, and born down by the authority of the Talmudiſts. This other ſect of Jews hold part of them, that moneths were alternatively full and hollow; other of them, that each moneth had 30 dayes. Among thoſe who embraced the former opinion, the authour of Seder Olam Rabba, and jarchi reckon the 17. day of Marcheſchvan the firſt, and the 27. of Caſleu the laſt day of the fourtie in which the rain deſcended; the 28. of Caſleu the firſt, and the 29. (or laſt day) of Jiar the laſt day of the 150. in which the waters prevailed upon the earth; and the 17. of Siwan (which is the ſeventh moneth to Caſleu in which the rain ceaſed) the day on which the ark began to reſt on the mountains of Ararat; and the tenth moneth, on the firſt day of which the mountains appeared, to be Ab, the tenth to Marcheſchvan in which the rain began to deſcend. The firſt of Siwan, on which the waters began to decreaſe, is computed the firſt of the fourty dayes, after which Noah opened the window of the ark.</p>
            <p>Some writers, who believe that the moneths in Noahs time were one full, and another hollow throughout the yeare, conceive that the ark reſted on the mountains of Ararat on the 17. of Niſan, and leaſt there ſhould want room for the 150. dayes, affirm that the yeare of the floud was <hi>emboliſmaeus.</hi>

The ark (with S.

Nachmanides and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel affirm, that it reſted upon the mountains of Ararat on the ſeventeenth of Niſan.</note>Some quoted by Nachmanides preferre the 17. of Jiar. They allow a moneth for the abating of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after the end of 150. dayes in which the waters prevailed upon the earth. There's yet place for another opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was a double Adar in the time of the deluge, and the 150. dayes expired the ſpace of a full moneth before the 17. of Niſan. Thoſe who held that moneths then in the age of the floud were throughout common years one full and the next hollow, cannot unleſſe they intercalate a moneth between Marcheſchvan and Niſan, with any face of reaſon affirm that the ark reſted on the 17. of Niſan upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Ararat.

            <p>Thoſe who repute the moneth in which the ark reſted on Ararat, the ſeventh to the beginning or end of the rain, not to the beginning of the yeare, are ſufficiently refuted by Abarbinel. He well obſerveth (upon the Paraſchah <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Abarbinel judgeth thoſe, as altogether irrationall, not to be heard, who reckon not a ſecond, and ſeventh, and tenth, and a firſt, and a ſecond moneth, mentioned in the ſame paraſchah, from the ſame beginning He meaneth, that moneths mentioned in the ſame paraſchah, and deſcribed by their order, have all of them the ſame individuall Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha, or <hi>Epochas ejuſdem rationis.</hi> Thoſe five moneths mentioned in the 7. and 8. chapter of Geneſis, are all to be reckoned from the beginning of the yeare, but three of them are deſcrib'd by their poſture in the 600. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two by their order in the 601. yeare of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's life. Sacred Chronology contain'd in the hiſtory of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:110803:93"/>
the deluge, is much diſordered, if the beginning of Siwan be made (as in Seder Olam Rabba) the epocha of the 40 dayes, at the end of which Noah opened the window of the ark, or if part of them be diſpoſed before the firſt of the tenth moneth.</p>
            <p>I cannot but much preferre that opinion, which maketh the meaſure of the civill moneth in Noahs time 30. dayes. Nothing is repugnant to it in the hiſtory of the floud. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch computation, although no moneth were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalated between the ſecond and the ſeventh, the reſting of the ark ſhould not be protruded by the 150 dayes in which the waters prevail'd, beyond the 17. of Niſan.</p>
            <p>The Karites who make the ſecond moneth (which they conceive to have been Jiar) hollow, include in the 150. dayes of rain, both the whole 17. of the ſecond, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the 7. moneth. But the ark reſted on the 17. of the 7. moneth, yet not till after the ſpace of 150. dayes in which the waters prevailed. It may be objected, that Luk. 2.21. eight dayes are ſaid to be accompliſhed, which were not completely paſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>And when eight dayes were accompliſhed for the circumciſion of the child.</hi> He was circumcis'd on the eighth day. Eight dayes may be ſaid to be accompliſhed, or the number of eight dayes to be filled up, whether the eighth day be current or completed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Had the ſame phraſe been uſed, Gen. 8.3. had it been ſaid, <hi>When</hi> 150 <hi>dayes were accompliſhed, the waters were abated,</hi> the words might poſſibly, but ſhould not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie, that the waters were abated before the end of 150 dayes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought rather to conceive, that the waters were not abated till the end of 150 dayes.

Scaliger (<hi>De Emend. Temp. l.</hi> 5.) aſſigneth to the moneths in the time of the deluge, the ſame quantity. The common yeare in Noahs time, contain'd as we ſee 360. dayes.</p>

            <p>I cannot aſſent to Lydyat, endeavouring to demonſtrate the meaſure of the yeare uſed in times ancienter then the confuſion of languages, <hi>à priori.</hi> I cannot ſee why I ſhould believe, that the long-liv'd Patriarchs uſed the moſt exact form of civill years, rather then that they were complete in all arts and ſciences.</p>
            <p>Neither can I conceive that Scaliger's doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercalations uſed in thoſe ancient times, is confirm'd unto us by due teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>We are uncertain (as I have prov'd) both concerning the number of years between the creation of the firſt, and the birth of the ſecond Adam, and likewiſe concerning the meaſures of years by which the affairs of the Iſraelites and their fore-fathers were computed in that ſegment of time. <hi>Incerta haec ſi quis poſtulat ratione certâ facere, nihilo

plus agat, quàm ſi det operam ut cum ratione inſauiat.</hi> My labour will not be thought needleſſe, unleſſe by ſuch as are ignorant, or elſe attend not that many have arrogated a kind of certainty to chronology in thoſe parts, which I have demonſtrated to be moſt uncertain, and that others have been ſo fond as to believe them. Sacred Chronology enableth us not to aſſigne to the events regiſtred in the Scriptures, their true poſitures in the age of the world. Humane Chronology leaveth us much more perplexed and doubtfull. Beſides that it is not agreed by writers of good note, what is the diſtance of any other ancient remarkable epocha from the creation, or from any time near us, ſcarce about the diſtance of any epocha from another, whether on this ſide or beyond it; famous events are variouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in time reckoned from each Aera. Learned Maſter Broughton hath plentifully diſcovered, that there is much difference among the Greek writers in chronicling things according to the Olympiads. The Romane Conſuls are diverſly liſted in the Capitoline and Sicilian Calenders; and Epiphanius departeth from both. The Jews are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the accompt us'd by their forefathers in the land of Canaan, and ſome of them derive their preſent accompt from our firſt parents. It's ſufficiently clear'd, that Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology (beſides that detriment which it ſuſtaineth by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Jews uncertain accompt) compar'd with other parts of the Encyclopaedia, laboureth with a triple diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

The firſt and ſecond difficulty are frequent (I confeſſe) in other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of hiſtory (uſually ſo call'd) the third is almoſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Chronology; many parts of learning are wholly exempted from them all.

               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:110803:95"/>I readily acknowledge that ſome parts of Chronologie conferre much to the knowledge of things which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to time, and of things diſtinct from them. Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my relieth much upon the records of the times in which Aſtronomicall obſervations were made. Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and Aſtrology may be advanc'd by the times of the events upon earth; compar'd with the poſitures of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. A rule cannot be founded upon a ſingle obſervation. Hiſtories which are converſant about the ſame times, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually explain one another. The Chronology in heathens, if we deal with infidels may con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>liate credit to the ſacred Scriptures. We are much enabled to judge of teſtimonies concerning the cuſtomes and events of former ages, by knowing in what riches the authours lived. Laſtly, Gods providence is much illuſtrated by Chronology, as it infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth us that ſinne hath ſometimes been puniſhed whilſt it was in act, or immediately after; and that Gods ſervants have been delivered in times of their greateſt ſtraits and neceſſities. Theſe advantages we may receive in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from ſuch chronology as former ages have tranſmitted to us, howſoever perplex'd and imperfect. Of ſuch I ſpake before, not of Chronology in the abſtract, nor according to ſuch actuated perfection as it was capable of. Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers oft vary in their reports, and ſometimes are ſo counterpoiz'd, that it's difficult to pronounce any party vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious. <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> the more ancient are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before later, who were more intelligent before ſuch as were leſſe skilfull; thoſe who wrote without prejudice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch whoſe affections were engag'd; the more honeſt, before ſuch as were leſſe conſciencious, &amp; a greater number before a leſſe. Advantages are ſometimes ſo diſtributed, that the controverſie cannot be determined. But what's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred onely by one authour, much more what by many, if it neither be repugnant to any artificiall reaſon, nor yet contradicted by any teſtimony, may juſtly challenge our aſſent. The concurrence of ſome events and order of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

            <p>It's already confeſs'd that Chronology abſtracted from its uſefulneſſe (which may fitly be termd <hi>Chronologie ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liata</hi>) is an ornament to the underſtanding; moreover, that Chronology is helpfull to the judgement; memory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſcencie likewiſe receive much aid from the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time and place, but almoſt equall from theſe true and feigned.</p>
